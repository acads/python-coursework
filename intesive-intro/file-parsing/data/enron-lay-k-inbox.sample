Energy Expected on Political Front Burner in 2002

In the next six weeks, energy should be prominent in national politics.  The
Bush Administration is sure to return its attention to the national energy
policy in the State of the Union Address January 29.  The President is
expected to emphasize that economic recovery depends on congress passing his
domestic agenda, including the Administration's energy plan passed by the
House last year.  In the Senate, Majority Leader Tom Daschle has vowed to
bring an energy bill to the floor the week of February 11.  Also in
February, The White House is expected to release federal its budget, which
will reveal the spending priorities of the Administration, showing which
energy efficiency programs receive funding increases or funding cuts.

FreedomCAR Replaces PNGV as Government Body for Energy-Efficient Vehicle R&D

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced at the Detroit Auto Show that the
Partnership for Next Generation Vehicles (PNGV) will be replaced by a new
private-public partnership, called "FreedomCAR."  PNGV was a public-private
partnership designed to develop cars with triple the current fuel economy.
FreedomCAR, by contrast, has as its goal the production of hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles, which produce no emissions but water vapor and do not rely on
fossil fuels.

While supportive of fuel cell R&D, the Alliance noted in New York Times and
other media interviews that it should not be at the expense of badly needed
new fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, including SUVs.

A political cartoon by Stuart Carlson illustrates the point quickly and
humorously:

Primen: Consumers Say Energy Efficiency Now Top Issue in Home Appliance
Purchases

U.S. consumers now rank energy efficiency as their most important
consideration in shopping for new home appliances, according to a new study
by Madison-based Primen, an energy market-intelligence company.
Three-fourths of consumers said energy efficiency was a very important
factor in their purchase of appliances during the past year. More important,
84 percent said they anticipate that energy efficiency will be a "very
important consideration" in making future purchasing decisions.
Pro-efficiency sentiment ran strongest among California consumers, with an
overwhelming number of households claiming efficiency will outrank all other
factors in future appliance-purchasing decisions.

California Sees Big Savings by Tightening Efficiency Standards

The California Energy Commission (CEC) will propose adopting new efficiency
standards for ten products at a February 6 hearing, as mandated by
legislation in response to the state's electricity crisis. Products range
from air conditioners to traffic signals.  CEC's life-cycle-cost analysis
shows that the energy savings over the life of the product outweigh any
initial increased purchase cost.  Among the largest savers: electric
transformers reduce life-cycle-costs by $3,768; commercial air conditioners
by $2,580; and commercial refrigerators by $958.

A table illustrates savings from tighter standards:

Efficiency, Conservation Could Save NW States 300 Megawatts

Energy efficiency and conservation in the Northwest could yield as much
power as a new natural gas plant-an extra 300 megawatts over three
years-according to the Northwest Power Planning Council (NPPC). As a result
of these findings, NPPC is asking Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Washington to
invest in efficiency and conservation measures rather than the construction
of new power plants.  Power savings will come from a wide variety of
sources-from modernizing machinery to shutting down vending machines during
off-hours.  NPPC is a multi-state agency with a mandate to balance power
production and environmental concerns in the Pacific Northwest.

Study Cites Five-fold Return on Energy Training Investment in Plants

Investments in energy-efficiency training saved ICI Chemicals, a British
chemical company, ?500,000 (1992 currency) for a ?100,000 investment: a
ten-week payback.  This information was released in a paper written for the
Training Subcomittee of the BestPractices Steam Program.  ICI Chemicals
invested in its people, implementing a training program including direct
training, employing a full-time energy manager, metering, and expending
revenue on repairs and minor improvements.  These findings are explicated in
"The Human Side of Efficiency:  The Value of Training in Plant Systems
Optimization," which includes other examples of the value of training.  A
companion slide show to the paper links to further examples and resources of
how to implement a training program.

Energy Efficiency Methods Can Yield 50 Percent Reductions in Data Center
Power Requirements, Says REPP Report

The Information Technology industry and electric power utilities have a
"window of opportunity to define and implement best practices in data center
design and construction before the next Information Technology surge," notes
Renewable Energy Policy Project (REPP) Research Manager Fred Beck.

Based on extensive research and interviews with industry experts, Beck
details many practical efficiency measures that can be implemented today, as
well as identifying broader solutions such as ultra-efficient "Energy Smart
Power Parks" employing shared electricity production and cooling facilities.

CFLs Capture High California Marketshare

Energy Star compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) have captured a higher
marketshare in California than ever in the 20 year history of
energy-efficiency programs.  The expanded marketshare is due in part to the
"Instant Discount Retailer Program" by California Investor Owned Utilities
(IOUs) to promote the purchase and use of CFLs by residential consumers in
partnership with retailers and manufacturers that were customer-oriented and
cost-effective.  Noted factors that have contributed to the success of the
2001 program include consumer education; greater accessibility of
next-generation CFLs, together with their higher quality, lower price, and
decreased size; and the competitive nature of the marketplace.

By the end of the Instant Discount Retailer Program in December 2001,
Pacific Gas and Electric Company reports that 42 retailers with 434
locations in Northern and Central California had participated to provide
discounts on 6 million CFLs accounting for $18 million dollars in
incentives.

'Static Electricity House' Brings Down House; Garners $16 Million Free TV
Airtime for Energy Efficiency Message

The Alliance to Save Energy obtained some $16 million of free TV airtime for
its "Static Electricity House" national TV PSA and a customized New York
version developed for the New York State Energy Research and Development
Authority.

Nielsen Sigma tracking reports that the national TV PSA was aired more than
38,000 times for 462 million total impressions from December 2000 through
December 2001.  Additionally, the national TV PSA was picked up by the ABC
and CBS TV networks, CNN Headline News, other cable networks, local cable
operators, and CNN Airport Network at 35 major airports which are not
tracked by Nielsen and which would push all of the total values
significantly higher.

More than a year later, past this tracking time frame, there are reports of
sightings this month in San Francisco and Washington D.C. markets and on
cable. Typical of the e-mails received by the Alliance, Eve Norman of San
Francisco writes: "I LOVE this commercial. This has got to be one of the
funniest spots I've ever seen. First time I saw it, I was dozing on the
couch, woke up thinking for a moment that it was serious. What a great idea:
using static electricity. Of course, I then realized it was a very clever
spoof.  Thanks, for a good laugh plus valuable information."

EYE OPENERS

Energy Efficiency Is Patriotism

A new web site has been created for people who want to contribute to the
effort against terrorism and who want to address the primary causes both of
anti-American sentiment and American dependence on foreign oil.  America
consumes a disproportionate share of world oil resources, which has brought
a disproportionate amount of risk to America - risks to our health, safety,
economy, and national security.

At www.SaveABarrel.org, visitors are asked to take a "Patriot's Energy
Pledge."   The Patriot's Energy Pledge Campaign(tm) SaveaBarrel.org(tm)
website was developed by "a bipartisan group of concerned citizens who
strongly believe that reducing our country's use of oil is essential to our
national security."

Labor Conditions and Worker Rights in China and Hong Kong

Monday, January 28, 2002, 3:00-5:00 p.m.
Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI

China's supply of cheap labor has drawn textile and electronic manufacturing jobs from the United States and many developing Asian countries. These jobs have not necessarily brought prosperity to the majority of Chinese workers-in fact, discontent has grown. An excess of unemployed rural workers and an increase in laid-off workers from closed or privatized state-owned enterprises has produced an angry and demoralized workforce. Worker demonstrations have been mounted in all parts of China, many regarding corruption in factory management. Some China watchers view this worker unrest as a recipe for instability and eventual chaos. The members of this panel suggest a possible solution: independent worker organizations in which workers can protect their own interests and contribute to the solution of some of the nation's economic problems, particularly corruption, through a democratic process. Panelists will also address related issues in Hong Kong.

THE PEARL HARBOR DECEPTION

The creators of "Pearl Harbor" -- the new movie debuting Friday that
Hollywood insiders are calling "'Titanic' with fighter planes" --
have missed a vital aspect of Pearl Harbor history.

Although the movie's emphasis is on entertainment, not historical
enlightenment, during the film's production Jerry Bruckheimer, the
producer, made sure to consult Pearl Harbor survivors, historians,
and government officials. But one perspective he never took seriously
is one based on secret U.S. documents recently declassified under the
Freedom of Information Act.

"Overwhelming evidence contained in the May 2000 Freedom of
Information Act release," writes Robert B. Stinnett in the new
paperback edition of his book DAY OF DECEIT: The Truth About FDR and
Pearl Harbor, "reveals that by mid-November 1941, as Japanese naval
forces headed for Hawaii, America's radio cryptographers had solved
the principal Japanese naval codes and that Japan's top admirals went
on the Japanese naval airwaves and in a series of radio messages
disclosed that Pearl Harbor was the target of their raid."

"Based on these transmissions, President Roosevelt and General George
Marshall predicted war with Japan would begin the first week of
December. We would know even more about what FDR and his chief
advisors thought, but the Japanese radio messages remain incomplete,
still cloaked in American censorship.... By continuing to classify
Japanese naval intercepts and their communication decoding data as
'national defense secrets,' the National Security Agency (NSA) has
done a disservice to the excellent cryptographers and the radio
intelligence obtained by monitor stations operated by the United
States and her allies in 1941, as well as to history itself."

"Nevertheless," concludes Stinnett, "the major secrets of Pearl
Harbor are at last out in the open. After years of denial, the truth
is clear: we knew."

Unfortunately, this truth will not be coming soon to a theater near you.

See Robert B. Stinnett's op-ed, "December 7, 1941: A Setup from the Beginning"
http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink3-20-1.html.

Forum, "Pearl Harbor: Official Lies in an American War Tragedy?" see

CHALLENGING THE FTC's HOSTILITY TO MERGERS

Although the Microsoft antitrust trial loomed largest in the public
consciousness, it was not the only important antitrust trial in
recent years. Another antitrust case -- the Federal Trade
Commission's successful challenge to the merger of two office-supply
"superstores" -- will have far-reaching effects, even if the
Microsoft case is ultimately thrown out on appeal.

The FTC prevented a proposed merger of Staples and Office Depot by
arguing that a merger would raise the price of office supplies,
citing evidence that office-supply prices were significantly higher
in cities with only one company operating office-supply superstores.

The defense accepted this evidence as true, but argued that higher
prices were explained by higher costs in one-firm markets. What they
didn't do, according to the judge, was to offer a unifying theory to
explain why one-firm markets might have higher costs. Economist Craig
M. Newmark offers such a theory, based on what economists call
"indivisibility rents," in a new Independent Institute working paper.

In essence, Newmark argues that the whole point of superstores is to
have a store large enough to minimize the costs of transportation,
advertising, and the like. In markets that can only support one
store, the market is often too small to minimize these costs. Hence,
the higher prices in these markets.

This theory, presented above in the sketchiest fashion, is consistent
with other evidence presented by the FTC. Markets having only two
office supply superstore chains were notably smaller than those with
three firms, suggesting that indivisibility was a factor.
Unfortunately, the FTC apparently didn't consider indivisibility in
its analysis.

"The indivisibility theory implies that the higher prices in one-firm
markets are not due to lack of competition; the merger should not
raise prices."

Consumers and their representatives, then, should let the FTC know
that a knee-jerk hostility to mergers isn't in the public interest.
Checking for indivisibility should be a staple of FTC analysis.

"WILL ENCRYPTION PROTECT PRIVACY AND MAKE GOVERNMENT OBSOLETE?" --
David Friedman Transcript Now Online

Someone once said that the move toward civilization coincided with
the move toward privacy.

New advances in information technology allow the possibility of
greater privacy, but they also make it easier for government
bureaucrats, criminals, and other unwanted intruders to snoop into
your private life. Will privacy-enhancing technology outpace
privacy-threatening technology? Will freedom and civilization thereby
advance? Or will the new technology strengthen the rule of Big
Brother?

Economist and legal scholar David D. Friedman addressed these and
related issues in his recent Independent Policy Forum talk, "Will
Encryption Protect Privacy and Make Government Obsolete?" -- a
transcription of which is now available on the Independent Institute
website.

Leery of predicting the future, Prof. Friedman said that he would not
forecast beyond 30 years -- after that, all bets are off. For the
coming three decades, however, he predicts that "public key
encryption," a young technology increasingly used in e-commerce, is
likely to promote privacy -- unless the government acts immediately
to control its use.

Rather than control what people do with personal information about
you, public key encryption lets you decide with whom you want to
share that information. With it, we can better ensure that financial
information, health records, and other information will only go to
those we deem are on a need-to-know basis.

Further, public key encryption -- along with e-mail re-mailers -- can
promote anonymity, making it increasingly possible for you to buy and
sell over the Internet without the taxman knowing about it. And
"anonymous" companies in cyberspace can easily build a solid
reputation needed to gain a loyal customer base. Thus we may soon
have an underground cyber-economy that rivals the size of underground
economy in the real world.

Public key encryption also acts as a virtual Second Amendment,
according to Friedman. Just as the Second Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution institutionalized the self-defense of the citizenry
against a federal tyranny, so public key encryption will
institutionalize the self-defense of the citizenry against government
propaganda. Americans (and citizens of other countries) will be
better armed with the truth. Information about government
encroachment will be easier to spread and thereby help keep it in
check.

Privacy and Make Government Obsolete?" see

IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE:
1. The Regulatory Trap
2. World Freedom Index
3. Why Are the Public Schools Failing and What Can Be Done? -- Next
Independent Policy Forum (July 5, 2001)

-------------------------------------------------------------

THE REGULATORY TRAP

California's energy crisis is often portrayed as a failure of
deregulation. In reality, however, the restructuring of the Golden
State's power industry short-circuited rather than deregulated the
market process.

Legislation that squeezes all buyers and sellers into a short-term
spot market rather than lets them agree on the terms of their
contracts, imposes protectionist price floors that then become price
ceilings, and tilts the playing field against new suppliers and
distributors can be considered "deregulation" only in the sense that
Soviet-style economic planning can be considered "economic."

Had California taken deregulation seriously, it is likely that
electricity would be more plentiful and cheaper than before, as in
Pennsylvania, where deregulation, while still not 100 percent, is at
least worthy of the title.  But why didn't California legislators
attempt genuine deregulation? More broadly, why is deregulation so
seldom attempted anywhere, despite the fact the economists routinely
take pains to show how regulation is wasteful?

Economists often argue that resistance to deregulation stems mostly
from the fact that the benefits of deregulation are spread out among
potentially millions of people, while the benefits of regulation are
concentrated; the few who benefit find it easier to politick for
their cause.

While this is often a factor, there are several other reasons why
regulations become entrenched, according to economist Fred S.
McChesney. First, politicians assume that the public can live with
the status quo. Second, deregulation is likely to be entrusted to the
very politicians and bureaucrats who oversaw, and politically
benefited from, the existing regulatory regime. Third, regulation's
beneficiaries would expect to be paid off by the deregulation's
beneficiaries. Fourth, some of the costs of regulation are sunk,
e.g., spent on lobbying, and therefore can't be recovered by
deregulation. Fifth, the government may well confiscate the gains of
deregulation through taxes.

What McChensey explains is the existence for a stubborn regulatory
"lock-in," which unlike the urban myths of market lock-in (refuted in
Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis's persuasive book, WINNERS,
LOSERS AND MICRSOFT), does not go wanting for empirical examples.

"As many have noted, regulation is much easier to get than to get rid
of. The predictable path, once regulation has been adopted, is a
series of ratchets upward."

Here McChesney relies on the notion of a ratchet effect (described in
detail in Independent Institute senior fellow Robert Higgs's book,
CRISIS AND LEVIATHAN): Each new government regulation or program
creates a new baseline from which it rarely if ever retreats.

This description of the regulatory state is apt, but let us suggest a
more vivid one. As in the old Roach Motel TV commercials, regulations
check in, but rarely check out. This metaphor at least has the
advantage of helping us keep in mind the sort of critters we are
dealing with.

INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Spring 1999), at

WORLD FREEDOM INDEX

According to the 2001 Index of Economic Freedom, only 12 countries,
representing 7 percent of the world's countries, can be considered
free. The report is overly optimistic, however; it overstates the
freedom and understates the repression in the freer countries,
according to Paul Craig Roberts, research fellow at The Independent
Institute, in a recent syndicated column.

"Hardly any of the index's 12 free countries are really free," writes
Roberts. "For example, both the United States and Great Britain fall
in the 'repressed category' of the index with regard to tax burden,
as do Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Australia."

The share of personal earnings collected as government taxes in the
index's freest countries often rivals the one-third taken from feudal
serfs by their lords or the fifty percent taken from 19th century
slaves by their masters.

"How can property rights be secure when taxation can claim a feudal
lord's or slave master's share of a citizen's working time?" asks
Roberts.

Further, property rights are seldom fully secure even in the index's
highest-ranking countries. For example, "U.S. property owners are at
grave risk of many federal, state and local laws that permit their
property to be seized on the slightest pretext. In 80 percent of
asset forfeitures, no charges are brought against the former owners.
To overlook this great insecurity of property in the United States is
to concoct a fanciful measure of property rights."

What the index really shows, Roberts concludes, is that there are
virtually no free countries in the world.

WHY ARE THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS FAILING AND WHAT CAN BE DONE? -- Next
Independent Policy Forum (July 5, 2001)

American children learn less than they did 30 years ago, and even
where there are signs of improvement, they are small. Many high
school graduates -- 90 percent of whom attended government-operated
public schools -- lack the skills needed in today's
knowledge-intensive workplace. Further, many students fail to
graduate. (The dropout rate in California is 32 percent overall, and
45 percent for immigrants.) Parents and educators have long
recognized the shortcomings of the public school system, but their
efforts to reform it have failed. Are school vouchers and charter
schools the answer? What about teacher-owned schools? What other
reforms might make schools more innovative and accountable to
parents? Please join us as education experts RICHARD VEDDER and JOHN
MERRIFIELD examine new strategies for achieving educational
excellence.

SPEAKERS:

   -- RICHARD VEDDER, Senior Fellow, The Independent Institute;
Professor of Economics, Ohio University; author, CAN TEACHERS OWN
THEIR OWN SCHOOLS?

   -- JOHN MERRIFIELD, Senior Research Associate; The Education Policy
Institute; Professor of Economics, University of Texas, San Antonio;
author, THE SCHOOL CHOICE WARS

Praise for Richard Vedder's book, CAN TEACHERS OWN THEIR OWN SCHOOLS?

"Vedder suggests for-profit schools owned and operated by teachers
and school administrators would offer a promising alternative to the
present public school system."
   -- SCHOOL REFORM NEWS

"Nobody yet has found a foolproof formula for revitalizing American
K-12 education. So let's be humble enough -- and empirical enough --
to try as many tantalizing approaches as we can. In that spirit, I
commend Richard Vedder's pioneering ideas."
   -- CHESTER E. FINN, JR., former Assistant Secretary, U.S.
Department of Education

For more information about CAN TEACHERS OWN THEIR OWN SCHOOLS?
see http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink3-22-8.html.

Praise for John Merrifield's book, THE SCHOOL CHOICE WARS

"Professor Merrifield asks this question: what is meant by and what
is the intended consequence of reforms bearing such labels as
vouchers, school choice, charter schools, privatization, and
competition? This book brilliantly and clearly exposes the
superficiality and extraordinary fuzziness of those labels."

Dear Mr. Lay,

Thank you for your email message. I imagine you are quite disenchanted with
India-specific issues, and in light of your staggering responsibilities, may
choose to spend little time on this email. I have enormous respect for you
as a leader. As such, I write to appeal to your finer sensibilities, and to
point out simple errors in the way the matter was probably explained to you,
and that which is evident in the email below. This explanation is important
to me for two reasons: (i) The size of the outstanding bonus is material to
me (ii) I do not wish for Enron to consider that there were any conflict of
interest issues during the course of my employment.

Conflict of Interest:
1. I had informed the entire senior management team of Enron India of the
investments I wanted to make in the internet companies, and of Global
Telesystems' role therein. I informed my CEO Sanjay Bhatnagar, my COO Wade
Cline, and my General Counsel Sandeep Katwala prior to my investments. From
time to time, my internet investment was joked about, talked about, and
discussed informally and openly  in senior management meetings, e.g. the PRC
meetings, strategy reviews etc. Furthermore, at the time I was starting the
companies, I had even sought the assistance of the GC in identifying outside
lawyers who could assist me in establishing complex cross-border legal
structures. I believe the three gentlemen I have mentioned will confirm this
point.

2. When Enron India's Broadband venture was merged with EBS Houston, the new
Houston based management did not know about my investment. This was quite
understandable, since there was little or no interaction between the two
groups prior to the merger. They asked for a full explanation, and I did so
through the process established by Kevin Hannon and Ken Rice: an inquiry by
Rob Walls. Furthermore, I offered to Rob Walls that if they felt there were
any perceived conflicts of interest, I would be willing to clear them in any
way as suggested by Houston. This would even include selling my investments
at a loss. My commitment to Enron was paramount.


At all times I maintained complete transparency on my investments. I
informed about them to everyone, from my administrative assistant to my CEO.
At the discretion of the management (Sanjay Bhatnagar was my manager for
2000, the year for which the bonus was to be paid), the amount decided was $
85,000. But when Sanjay Bhatnagar decided to leave Enron in early January
2001, Kevin Hannon terminated my employment on January 24. 2001. The
decision to not pay the bonus was made in retrospect by people who were not
my managers for the year in question, and was little else but punitive.
Indeed, Ken Rice and Rob Walls admitted in subsequent conversations to
Sanjay Bhatnagar that  there was no conflict of interest, but some action
had to be appear to be taken.

I sincerely hope the unpleasantness surrounding the Indian government's
dealings with Enron, as well as incomplete information that may have been
submitted to you by Kevin Hannon will not prejudice your decision in this
matter. May I request that the issue of the Bonus be reconsidered.

With warm regards and best wishes for your new role,

Annat Jain

Dear Mr. Jain:

Thank you for your email messages.  Prior to your termination, this
matter was reviewed by several members of Enron's Senior management
team, including Jeff Skilling and Kevin Hannon, two members of Enron's
Corporate Policy Committee.  I learned that although you were employed
at Enron India throughout calendar year 2000, there were significant
conflict of interest issues surrounding your involvement, while an Enron
employee, with two Internet companies and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Global Telecom.  As a result, Senior management determined that it would
be in the best interests of all parties to terminate the employment
relationship.

Upon your termination of employment, you were entitled to severance
under the Enron Corp. Severance Pay Plan.  However, the payment of
bonuses to employees is at the discretion of management and your
management team in place at the time of your termination determined, in
its discretion, not to pay a bonus to you.

During the course of your employment with Enron, your contributions were
recognized.  I wish you well in your future endeavors.

Very truly yours,


Kenneth L. Lay"

Dr. Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman of the Board
Enron Corp.


	Dear Dr. Lay,

We met less than a week ago, on Wednesday 16 May 2001, during the OECD Forum
2001 in Paris.

I'm an independent consultant and innovator, with a special interest in
energy and new technologies. I have more than ten years experience in
research and innovation in economics, business and technology.

I attended the session on energy you chaired during that OECD Forum. After
the session, I had a discussion with you. Unfortunately, your time was too
short. You gave me your card and asked me to write you.

As I told you, I think I can add value to your staff, bring new lines of
businesses to Enron and with them, many new clients. And above all,
unprecedented profits.

I am writing you to propose my contribution in these purposes. I'm mainly
making three proposals to Enron.

1.- Working for Enron as an external consultant.

Here, I would rather like to work on assignments, medium or long term, with
a preference for the following jobs: risk assessment and/or management,
strategic analysis on geopolitical, macroeconomics and societal issues. I
think these are important tasks for a company like Enron. The current
problems with Enron's Dabhol power plant in the Maharashtra state in India
stresses the kind of importance I'm mentioning.

I can also conduct surveys and provide Enron with technical and fruitful
information and policy recommendations. I've done a job like that recently,
on the oil-pipeline project in Chad and Cameroon. As you may already know,
this is a $4 billion project recently launched, with the support of the
World Bank, and led by three major energy firms: Exxon and Chevron of the
USA, and Petronas of Malaysia. I wrote a detailed and long report, which
combined public and private sectors' concerns, and also communities'
interests. Having operations worldwide, Enron I think needs the type of
technical works I've done on that major energy project.

I have a good expertise in energy economics. I attend international
congresses on that subject, for instance in Boston in January 2000. Since
more than five years, as a journalist or as an independent consultant, I
have been covering the works and studies of, or participated to workshops
and seminar organized by, the IEA (International Energy Association). I know
Mr. Robert Priddle, IEA chair, who also attended that energy session during
the OECD Forum 2001. I know the work he and his team of experts have been
doing.


2.- Being fully employed by Enron.

In this respect, I would prefer to work as a researcher for either Enron
Project Development and Management or Capital and Risk Management
departments. In these fields, I've also innovated. I've created among
concepts, tools and processes. For instance, the "Sensible Guide for
Action". This is a tool theoretically powerful and practically very
efficacious. It's main goal is to help decision-makers, in both private and
public sectors. The Sensible Guide for Action assists them in their approach
to solve technical problems. The SGA is a five-leaf bough.

I've also created a method to assess a firm capacity to create wealth. This
method can be adapted to fit some particular projects. The method is very
useful in countries where there's no stocks market, and where capital
markets are not sufficiently large. That's the case of underdeveloped
countries in general, where yet the energy demand if forecast to grow the
most in the coming decades. Enron cannot overlook this, or miss the business
and profit opportunities in this growth.


3.- The Business of Businesses.

Dear Dr Lay, if you accept this third proposal, it will probably be the best
investment Enron has ever made. I'm an independent researcher and
entrepreneur, with a strong quantitative analysis competence, and a
multidisciplinary background, both by education and professionally. I'm a
graduate in mathematics and in mechanical engineering (University of Paris)
and also in business and economics (Institut d'Etudes Politiques of Paris).

In this third proposal I'm bringing to Enron two key inventions I've made,
two types of financial products targeting consumers and companies. I believe
they will interest Enron.

These products have a market potential worldwide, unlimited. They will
create an entirely new industry: the business of businesses.

I'm currently looking for investors with whom I can launch those products.
We will be the world leader here, and remain in that position for a long
time before copycats try to reach us. I've created the products, and nobody
knows about them or about their extraordinary markets.

I started to talk to you about these products when we met, but you were
hurrying, and the many solicitations and noises of the Forum made it
difficult to explain my point. I'm writing you as you asked me, because
firstly I believe these products will interest Enron. Secondly I know how
these products will boost three types of Enron services: Online Marketplace;
Broadband Services; and Energy & Commodities. Plus, these products, and the
business of businesses they create are an excellent placement for Enron.

Among the many reasons why I believe my products will interest Enron are
these:

(i) Their market is global.
(ii) They are directly related to consumption and savings.
(iii) They're excellent saving vehicles, for instance for pension or life
insurance.
(iv) They concern payment transactions and transmissions (And thanks to
information technology, costs here decrease while productivity will grow).
(v) They are both offline and online business (These products will be
excellent for Enron e-business).
(vi) I want to be and remain a global leader.
(vii) The products' growth potential is borderless
(viii) There's no competitor and before copycats arrive we would have
strongly imposed ourselves as The Leader and the Reference, increasing
chances that customers remain faithful to us.
(ix) My products will allow Enron to beat its competitors.
(x) Enron will earn a lot of revenues, many new clients, and very big and
unprecedented profits.

I'm looking for investors willing to put around $7 million. Given that the
revenues generated can very rapidly reach the range of $500 million to $1
billion, that initial $7 million is a wise and very profitable investment.

If you're interested, I'm ready to present the products and its business
scenario to you. The business model is very innovative, unprecedented.

These products' market is the whole world. But the first three markets I
would like to attack are the UK, Germany and moreover, Japan.

Today's news about Japan is rather bad. Economists and many observers see a
declining Japan. Me not. They may be right from a pure statistical and
macroeconomic viewpoint. But they fail to see deeper. They overlook the
other face of Japan. For my part, I see great business opportunities in
Japan, today and for the coming decade. Particularly for the financial
products I'm proposing.

These financial products I want Enron to launch with me in Japan, perfectly
fit Japanese consumption manners, their problematic pension system, and life
insurance structure there.

Public pension systems are under pressure every where, particularly in
Japan. In Germany they are trying to reform it. But there's no consensus in
the governments (federal and states') or in the Parliaments (federal and
states'). Last week, Chancellor Gerhard Schr?der won some parliamentary
approval. But the package he proposed is far from solving the issue.

In the meantime, problems may accumulate, the situation could worsen. What
seems sure is that in a foreseeable future, governments, not only in Germany
but in all developed and ageing countries, will no longer be able to pay
pensions at the level they have promised or are continuing to promise.

An additional bad news, even company pensions will suffer. In today's
"Financial Times" (Tuesday 22 May 2001, page 17), Peter Thompson, incoming
chairman of the British National Association of Pension Funds "warned UK
workers that they would no longer rely on comfortable company". He adds that
"many wold have to work until they were 75 -- 10 years longer than the
current retirement age - if they wanted to enjoy a financially comfortable
old age".

Therefore, workers and citizens should start, right no! to save for
themselves. My products are here the best saving vehicle I know.

And to what I know of Enron, it seems to me that Enron's shareholders also
will appreciate the kind of new business and investment opportunity I'm
bringing to their company. They will allow Enron to create a new and
unprecedented business model that all its competitors will envy. In a way,
Enron will change for its advantage, the way to do business in general, and
energy business in particular, thanks to the "business of businesses"
concept I've elaborated.


Dear Dr. Lay, as I read in Enron's web site, the list of awards you have
received: impressive. Congratulations! Two qualities common to all of them
are leadership and creativity. I wish these will help you to catch the
wonderful opportunity I'm bringing to you, in order to allow Enron to
accomplish a phenomenal progress.

Leadership and moreover creativity are also two qualities I've been trying
to put into practice. This effort creates a sort of affinity between us.
Thus, I think we can easily understand one another, speaking in some way,
the same language. Hence an additional reason that brings me to write you
and to make my proposal directly to you.

Given what I've learned of Enron's vision and values, I would like to stress
four of the twelve headings that are listed in Enron "vision and values"
page: innovation, diversity, change and excellence. Four headings that are
at work in each of the three proposals I've just made to you. When I knew
you were coming to that Forum, I prepared some materials for you and was
ready to present my proposals to you in details and to answer all your
questions. I'm still ready to do it. I'm even ready to come to Houston for
that purpose.


In one recent Enron's ad, I read : "Enron: Endless possibilities". Let's
make it true. Let's do it together. Let's reap the enormous benefits of "The
Business of Businesses"!

Thank you.

Best regards.

Mr. Lay,

I just want to voice a note of encouragement and appreciation to you during this unsettling period.  I don't know you personally, but under your leadership Enron has achieved great things, and regardless of the outcome of the current situation (which I fully expect to be positive) you should know that a lot of us appreciate your contributions and leadership.

As an employee for over 11 years, I've seen a lot at Enron, both good and bad.  But in my career I've been with a number of major companies, and none have been as exciting as Enron.

I'll keep it short--your time is valuable.  Hang in there, we're behind you.  And thanks for the leadership--it's a truly rare commodity.

Finally we're forging ahead. We plan on publishing our much-delayed and
much-changed Aspen special issue in two weeks. We're really excited. We're
focusing now on the issue of globalization in the post-September 11 world.
All of your contributions in Aspen aided us immensely.
    The issue is going to be an unusual print-online package. In addition to
articles in the magazine that relate in various ways to the Aspen meeting,
we will be posting significant additional material online. For those of you
who answered our three questions prior to the meeting, we will be publishing
all of those--in full--on Fortune.com. But we also want to hear from you
about how your views have changed since August.
    We'd like you to answer the same three questions again now, assuming
your answers would now be different. Or you can simply send us a statement
about how your comments remain reflective of your views, or how and why you
think something else matters more.
    Our three questions were:
1) Once upon a time we committed ourselves to putting a man on the moon.
What kind of similar commitment should we make now? What's the "moon shot"
of the 21st century?

2) As the world heads down its current path, what should we fear most?

3) What issue or issues will most define our future?

    We need your replies by November 8 at the latest. Please send them to me
and to jbensko@Fortune.com.
    btw, many of you have asked if you could get copies of your portrait by
Michael O'Neill. We plan on sending each of you a print along with the
special issue when it is published.
    Send in those answers! Now! Please!

Ken: 
Good to hear your voice this morn.  As I said, I have intentionally avoiding bothering you guys until I had something to contribute. 
The info that follows is probably more than you want.  But I gave Paul your (almost) complete history and I think you should know his. 
First met in mid-fifties when I was at Dallas Fed and assigned for two weeks to NYFed to learn firsthand about open market operations on the trading desk, where Paul worked.  (I was an "Associate Economist" with FOMC and advised Dallas Fed President on policy and I accompanied him to those super-secret meetings.) 
Paul and I hit it off and when I left Treasury in 1961 Dillon let Bob Roosa bring Paul in to take over my duties.  By then I was with ABA in New York and Paul and I became friends during my frequent work with the Dillon Treasury and with Roosa. 
Paul left Treasury in about the mid-sixties to become VP of planning at Chase.  In late 1968, when David Kennedy asked me to be his number two, I said yes on two conditions: That I get a car for both business and personal use (okay) and that he bring in Volcker as under secretary for monetary affairs and that latter report directly to him, not through me (as had been Dillon's system).  He said okay if we could get Paul.  Upon which I went to Chase and, given the stipulations about reporting, he agreed to come. 
He hit it off great with DK's successors, Connally and then Shultz, and left in '74 (I think) to be pres of NYFed.  Markets in effect forced Carter to appoint Paul to head Fed in 1979, where he led the System into breaking the back of double-digit inflation (plus sharp but relatively short recessioin). 
I think he went with Wolfensohn from there and made a ton of money. After W left Paul took over and later sold out to Bankers Trust. 
Although Paul is an independent (traditonal at NYFed), he is very public-minded and also somewht left-of-center on public policy.  One of my many sins in eyes of Nixon's White House gang is the true belief that I put something over on them in getting Paul to join us.  Paul was for many years a member of ACCF board as favor to me but finally resigned over our estate-tax position last year (and never did like our capital gains positions).  He and Pug may be considered soulmates on some of these issues, especially estate tax. 
In our initial conversation this morning, Paul asked me if Skilling's resignation related to recent problems.  I said I did not know but did not think so. 
Paul is teaching at Princeton and looking for ways to give away his money, which he seems embarrassed to have.  His wife, who had chronic health problems, died a couple of years ago.  I think one of the children had health problems too. 
In our second conversation today I told Paul that I was convinced that Enron was (mentioned innovation awards) and still is a great company.  I strongly urged him to accept a relationship that would show his confidence and also advance your efforts. 
Good luck. Call or e-mail me if you have any questions or if there is anything else you want me to do.

Dear Mr. Lay,

I know that you are a very busy man and really don't have time to read messages from your employees, but I just had to write you of my thought and feelings.

I haven't been sleeping very well because I am heartbroken at what is happening to this wonderful company.  I really try to be positive about the outcome of it all, but the news seem to get worse and worse.  I am so worried about all of the lives that are being affected and what it's going to mean to all of us in the coming months. Also, as someone who only has a few years left before retirement, I am faced with the possibility that I will not have any supplemental retirement to help me live in a decent environment.  

I love Enron and all that it has made it great and will continue to work hard to make a contribution to its success.  However, I realize that it ultimately is up to you and your team to successfully resolve all the issues facing our company.   I have the faith that you can do that.

Mr. Lay, please allow me to be bold and ask you to  remember that "God is Always in Control" and he will help if only we ask him to.

Thank you so much for your time.

3) RFF New Publications
Fulfilling the Promise on Global Hunger
Religious fanaticism motivated the terror of September 11th, but poverty
and hunger remain the central obstacles to future world security. Over 800
million people remain chronically malnourished. In 1996, the United States
pledged with 185 other countries to halve this number by 2015. A new
research report by RFF's Mike Taylor and Jody Tick documents that this
commitment has not been backed by effective action. There has been no real
budget commitment, no focused leadership, and no accountability for
results. The report calls on President Bush to clearly define U.S.
interests in and objectives for global hunger and vest responsibility and
accountability for results in the Secretary of State and administrator of
the Agency for International Development.
Michael Taylor and Jody Tick | September 2001

Improving Regulation: Cases in Environment, Health and Safety
This new book from RFF Press focuses on challenges to regulatory policy
during a time of rapid technological and societal change. It also examines
the impact of organizational politics, science, technology, and performance
on regulation.

Discussion Papers:
"RFF and Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology Evaluating the StarLink
Corn Case" StarLink - a type of bioengineered corn that produces its own
pesticide and was approved only for animal feed - was found in the human
food supply just over a year ago, prompting massive recalls of corn-based
products. Resources for the Future, in cooperation with the Pew Initiative
on Food and Biotechnology, is in the process of identifying and analyzing
the regulatory and public policy issues raised by the StarLink episode.

"State-Level Variation in Land-Trust Abundance: Could it Make Economic
Sense?"
Few economic analyses examine land trusts, their decisions, and the
land-trust "industry," despite their growing importance. For example,
statistics on the wide variation in the number of trusts in different
regions of the United States raise questions about whether such variation
makes economic sense. This paper builds a model to identify the optimal
number of private conservation agents. The model depicts two competing
forces: regional spatial externalities in conservation benefits that
increase the efficiency of having fewer agents and organizational costs,
and fund-raising specialization, which increases the efficiency of having
more agents. Using state-level variables, we perform a count-data analysis
of the number of trusts conserving land in each state. We find that the
number of trusts actually observed is consistent with the optimal number of
trusts that is predicted by the model on the basis of the relative
importance of spatial externalities and organizational size in different
regions.

"An Economic Assessment of Space Solar Power as a Source of Electricity for
Space-Based Activities"
We develop a conceptual model of the economic value of space solar power
(SSP) as a source of power to in-space activities, such as spacecraft and
space stations. We offer several estimates of the value based on interviews
and published data, discuss technological innovations that may compete with
or be complementary to SSP, and consider alternative institutional
arrangements for government and the private sector to provide SSP.

Dear Ken,

I had the opportunity to talk to nearly all Foundation Board and Council
members. There is great enthusiasm about the decision to move next year's
Annual Meeting exceptionally from Davos to New York and, in such a way, to
underline the role of the Annual Meeting 2002 as a partnership platform to
elaborate a roadmap for the future and a comprehensive response to the
tragic events of 11 September. The key advice given was
- to make sure that we carry the spirit of Davos to New York
- that we make sure to have a strong international participation and
- that, finally, the key challenges are dealt with in a spirit of
cooperation and collaboration.
We need now your help and partnership to make sure that "Davos in New York"
becomes not only a success, but a substantial contribution to fulfill our
mission: to improve the state of the world.

We will be back for operational matters.

With warmest regards,

It really hurts whatever is happening to us (ENRON).  Maybe you and the rest of the management group have thought of this already but I still want to give my suggestion just in case it is not being considered as an option.  Can Enron possibly ask Washington DC (our government) to rescue us.  When I was in Pennsylvania I used to work for a railroad company and that company was in trouble for a while and the government gave help.  Now that Railroad is a private sector and making money and is contributing to the state as well as the local communities.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.Message-ID: <5196593.1075862886528.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Dear Mr. Lay,

My manager and I were discussing the possibility of doing a fund raiser for Enron.  We contributed an absorbant amount of money to charities this year and last, would it not be possible to raise money to help our company.  Do a little belt tightening.  We could do without the Christmas party, do without our bonuses and next year at this time, when we are back on top, it would be a sweeter glory knowing that the employees helped turn everything around.  I have spoken with my HR rep and several other employees about this possibility and we feel that we would be able to raise a substantial amount of money.  Please let me know what your view on this would be and we will work on what steps we need to take to make it happen.

Thank you for your time.

A request for 2002 contribution was mailed from the NCPA in error this week.
We realize Enron is going through a tough time, and wanted to apoligize for
sending a request for money at this time.

John and I wish you our best, and know your strength will overcome this
challenge.

We appreciate your efforts on our behalf, and look forward to seeing you in

Ken,

I greatly appreciate your reply, I also agree that the merger was the best alternative, given the circumstances. It saddens me to think that I will not be working for Enron, I had planned to retire from here.  I pray that you will be at peace with your decision and that you will have a happy retirement, put it all behind you and know that you did everything you could and we have a great amount of respect and appreciation for you.  We will definitely miss you and your leadership.  I hope that Dynegy appreciates the value that they are obtaining and the gift of the talented and innovative employees that they will be getting.  Everything will work out for the best.

Thank you again for your response.

Always dedicated,

Ken:

Pete van de Gohm and I attended the NPC meeting in Washington on June 6 where the final draft Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) subcommittee document was presented to the Secretary of Energy and the NPC membership.  The draft document was accepted and the final document is being prepared.

At your request, we are pleased to continue working with Archie Dunham and the NPC subcommittee to attack the next phase of the project, the development and implementation of an Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or ISAC.  The ISAC will be the tool in providing threat information to the industry and is the main focus of the CIP project.

This next phase may require the involvement of an Enron attorney and a business lead as the ISAC will likely take the form of an LLC or similarly structured entity.  We will address these as the need arises with Jim Derrick and Steve Kean.

We feel we have made a great contribution to the energy industry by moving this project forward, and we are eagerly looking forward to our continued involvement.

Regards,

Mike HicksMessage-ID: <6548196.1075862888456.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

WOW!  I always new you cared about us but reading this made me cry.  We have been lucky to have you!  I hope your family enjoys you as much as your extended family here at Enron does.  I've only contributed to Enron for two years but I've always been very proud of Enron and will continue to be proud regardless of what happens long term.  Take care and remember most of us are saying a lot of prayers.

Subject: Change of Control Provisions




As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:

Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.
Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.
If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:
Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.
Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.
(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.)
We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.
EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction
The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction
That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.
We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms.
Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal.Message-ID: <1621598.1075845189863.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

I wanted to inform you of an investment opportunity with Shawn Gross.  =20
=20
He planning on developing a 2.5-acre tract at the corner of Kirby &  Braesw=
ood.  This location as you know is close to the medical center area  and su=
rrounded quality old neighborhoods.  Two apartments in the area have  been =
very successful.  The Providence across the street is getting rental  rates=
 in the $1.22 per square foot and Kirby Place, an older apartment complex, =
 is getting $1.13 per square foot.
=20
The preliminary plan is to develop three or four story structures with a  t=
otal of approximately 110 or 150 units, respectively.  The total  project c=
ost are projected to be $8.1 million or $10.9 million.  Capital  required f=
or this development is between $1.6 million (for the three story  developme=
nt) and $2.2 million (for the four story development).  An  additional call=
 later on during development could be around $200,000 due to  increasing co=
sts (i.e, increase in lumber prices).  The property would  probably be comp=
leted 18 months out.  Projected IRRs are between 20% to 28%  depending on t=
he sale of the property.  Return on Cash Invested starts at  approximately =
11% in 2002 and increases steadily up 20% around 2006.   Assumptions are: $=
1.22 per square foot rents; revenues & expenditures rising  3.5%; vacancy l=
oss of 5%; Cap Rate of 8.5%; total project cost between $8.1  million and $=
10.9 million, depending on three or four stories.  There is an  issue with =
the property being in the 100-Year Floodplain, but he is proposing to  alle=
viate the problem by creating a water feature on the property and raise the=
  grade of builderable area above the Floodplane.
=20
I spoke to Jenard about the project before I've been able to discuss it  fu=
rther with Shawn.  I asked him about some of the assumptions, such  as the =
rental rates and cap rates which I thought where a bit aggressive.   He tol=
d me to the contrary, that Shawn's other project is pulling in  similar rat=
es, as well as other non-Shawn projects.  With regards to the  cap rate, he=
 said that he has been seeing 8%, which would call for a greater  sales pri=
ce than the assumed 8.5% (I can discuss this in further detail for  anyone =
who doesn't understand cap rates).  Jenard is investing 15% of  the capital=
 required as a limited partner (same terms as the rest of the  partners) an=
d Shawn is investing 5% (4% as a limited partner, 1% as GP).   Shawn will b=
e the developer, JMG Builders will be doing the construction, and  JMG Mana=
gers, Ltd. will be managing the property.  In otherwords, Dad will  have hi=
s construction company and management company doing the project.   Shawn wi=
ll be the developer.  While the property is under operation there  should b=
e distributions (not treated as capital returned).  At the time of  sale, m=
ortgage refinance, or other capital event, after all debts have been  repai=
d, all of the partners will get their capital contribution back.   Then, pr=
ofits are distributed.  I can go through the partnership structure  for tho=
se who are interested, which includes distributions and fees.  =20
=20
I am considering investing in 1% to 2% of the deal.  A 1% percent  investme=
nt amounts to either $16,000 or $22,000 invested, depending on the three  o=
r four story scenario, plus the possible additonal cash call of $2,000.   T=
here are several risks (i.e., softening of rental rates) which dooesn't mak=
e  the returns a guarantee.  However, I feel good about the Houston  econom=
y and absorption rates in the residental (and commercial) markets for  Hous=
ton.  Feedback from Jenard regarding his developments in  Houston and Steve=
 Keller's South Rice Apartment development have all been  extremely positiv=
e.  Shawn's personal developments include:  one in  Houston completed and d=
oing great;  the other Houston project never got  developed because someone=
 offered him so much money on the land, he and his  partners had to take it=
 (not a bad problem considering it took the risk out of  developing and ret=
urned an enormous IRR to the investors).  Although he has  not developed mu=
ch, his father is an investor and will have some  involvement.  Money inves=
ted would be tied-up for at least two years  (unless something happens like=
 his last project), but up until a sale which  could take between 2 to 5 ye=
ars (or longer) there could be distributions.   That assumes that the proje=
ct is doing well.
=20
Anyway, please let me know if any of you are interested.  The deal  is sche=
duled to fund June 10.  Like I said, I have not heard from him  on all the =
specifics.  Therefore, I don't know at this time how much is of  the deal i=
s even available.  I would be glad to discuss this in greater  detail with =
any of you that are interested.
=20

This Is It! is where it's at  for soul food 
By KATHI MOSBACHER
Houston Chronicle
Published: May 24,  1996
IN 1959, when Frank and Mattie Jones were  shown the little house at 1003 Andrews in the heart of the Fourth Ward, Mattie  knew the search was over. "This is it!" she said. 
They knocked down  walls, converted the garage into a kitchen and started a business that has  become an institution - This Is It!, "soul food at its best," as it says on the  takeout menu. 
The couple remained at that location until 1983, when they  moved to 239 W. Gray. After 12 years there, Frank Jones' grandson, Craig Joseph,  and his wife, Georgette, moved the restaurant to its present location at 207 W.  Gray last spring. 
Mattie died last year, but 81-year-old Frank is still  cooking - from 5:30 in the evening until 10 the next morning -virtually the same  menu he has cooked for 37 years, with the assistance now of either Gladys  Jackson or Craig Joseph. 
Craig, a 36-year-old firefighter, says he and  his 35-year-old wife got involved in the restaurant because he couldn't bear to  see his grandparents' business sold to a stranger. 
When he's not  fighting fires - a job he says he still loves after 16 years and is able to do  because of his grandfather's presence at the restaurant - he joins Georgette at  This Is It! 
Georgette, who pretty much runs the show, also gets credit  for the new location's attractive decor and of course for her renowned peach  cobbler (she says they made B.B. King his own little cobbler when he was in town  recently to play at Rockefeller's). 
She firmly believes that "we have  the best soul food in Houston. It's kind of rare to find a place where you can  get a plate of food without having to worry about adding more salt or pepper. .  . . It's just perfect." 
"The secret to our success is how we season our  food," says Craig, whose grandfather takes seasoning so seriously that he  insists that he or Craig do it themselves. 
They're right. The food is  well-seasoned when it's meant to be seasoned - during the cooking process, not  at the table. This is homemade soul food to make any Southerner's heart sing. Go  helpless with hunger before making the trip; the portions are huge, and you'll  want to eat every bite. 
Georgette says most people "say they'd prefer a  nap to going back to work" after tucking in to three generous slabs of what may  be the best meat loaf in town (available Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays).  
Fresh chopped garlic brings out the flavor in the beef, Craig believes,  and the tomato sauce is especially good, although he prefers the creamy,  fall-off-the-bone-tender turkey wings (a special on Tuesdays, Thursdays and  Saturdays). 
Georgette's favorite dish is BBQ Rib Ends, meaty chunks of  pork with the brisket end of the rib barely attached to the bone, full of flavor  and cooked until they've absorbed the sweet-hot barbecue sauce. Fortunately this  dish is available every day, because it's terrific. 
But my favorite dish  is the one Craig believes made This Is It! - the oxtails, which Georgette says  she'd never even heard of before she met Craig. Actually they are sliced beef  tails browned, then braised to deeply delicious perfection with lots of chopped  onions, garlic, bell pepper and celery. 
"I guarantee that if I let you  try them, you're going to want oxtails! They're on the steam table in the same  place every day," Craig says. 
Frank Jones says the restaurant runs  through about 300 pounds of oxtails a day. "When we opened in 1959, I used to  slice them myself and sold them for 89 cents a plate," he says. They're $6.50  now and come with a choice of three vegetables and heavenly corn-bread muffins.  
I recommend a heaping plate of the oxtails with their dense, rich brown  gravy spooned over white rice; cabbage, which is seasoned with small chunks of  smoky bacon and given more texture than usual by the addition of the darker,  coarser outer leaves; and maybe the green beans, cooked according to  well-founded Southern tradition, not al dente.
Of course, you could play  it safe and go with the buttery, golden-crusted baked chicken or the classic  pepper steak (Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays). 
Dessert is a must. Beyond  Georgette's peach cobbler is a selection of unimprovable lush, moist cakes, all  baked on the premises. 
This Is It! offers breakfast seven days a week,  the only meal not served cafeteria-style. Everything is cooked to order and  right on the mark, from the well-seasoned grits with a little pool of butter on  top to the pancakes. All eggs come with a choice of grilled pork chops, bacon,  two kinds of sausage or slices of sweet, baked ham. 
The restaurant may  also be the perfect source for fried turkey (available with 48 hours' notice).  My friends in Louisiana tell me that the tradition of frying turkeys began at  summer crawfish boils, rather than during the holidays, using the same equipment  for both tasks. I recommend ordering one for your next picnic or country outing.  
Prices: breakfast $3.50-$4.50, lunch and dinner (one entree, three  vegetables and corn bread) $6.50 Hours: breakfast 6:30 a.m.-10 a.m. daily; lunch  and dinner 11 a.m.-8 p.m. Mondays-Thursdays, 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Fridays-Saturdays,  and 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Sundays.

1. Anthrax Panic Hijacks Pharmaceutical Industry
2. If Environmentalists Owned the Alaskan Oil Fields...
3. Growing Recognition of a Growing Government

-------------------------------------------------------------

ANTHRAX PANIC HIJACKS PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY

The Bush administration's recent "success" in securing low prices
from Bayer AG, the German drug manufacturer, for Cipro, its
anti-anthrax antibiotic, will ultimately reduce rather than protect
the health of Americans, according to a new op-ed by economists
Michael Reksulak and William F. Shughart, a research fellow at The
Independent Institute.

Bayer agreed to slash its prices to the U.S. only because of strong
intimidation by the federal government. Some in Congress have called
for the U.S. government to override Bayer's patent protection for
Cipro, which expires in 2003, unless Bayer reduces the price of Cipro.

Patent protection is especially important in the pharmaceutical
industry, because it helps ensure that a company can recover its
massive outlays for research and development, as well as make up for
the delays and uncertainties associated with the FDA approval process.

But "letting the 'anthrax scare'... break this link between up-front
investments and future profits reduces the expected returns to R&D
and greatly increases the uncertainty of the whole drug development
system," Reksulak and Shughart write.

"An increase in the number of companies permitted to produce Cipro
now -- or forced reductions in the antibiotics' price -- means that
fewer new drugs will be produced in the next 10 to 20 years than
would have otherwise been the case. Already willing to sell drugs to
governments at steep discounts, drug makers now have to worry that
they may be bullied into accepting even lower returns or face the
loss of patent protection altogether."

By threatening private property rights and undermining the rule of
law, the U.S. government's shakedown of Bayer, Reksulak and Shughart
conclude, "are far more damaging than any single terrorist attack has
ever been."

and William F. Shughart II, at

IF ENVIRONMENTALISTS OWNED THE ALASKAN OIL FIELDS...

Legislation that would permit oil exploration in Alaska's Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) may soon reach the president's desk.
(U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Tom Daschle, says he will allow the
bill to go to a floor vote when there are 60 senators who support it.)

In response, many environmental groups, most notably the Audubon
Society, have renewed their strong opposition to drilling in the
ANWR. Ironically, however, if environmentalists owned ANWR, they
would probably allow drilling, using the proceeds to help promote
their conservation elsewhere, according to Dwight R. Lee, writing in
the fall 2001 issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW.

"Consider what an environmental group would do if it owned ANWR and
therefore bore the costs as well as enjoyed the benefits of
preventing drilling," writes Lee.

In fact, the Audubon Society does allow oil drilling on an oil field
it owns, the 26,000-acre Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary in Louisiana.

"The willingness of environmental groups such as the Audubon Society
to allow drilling for oil on environmentally sensitive land they own
suggests strongly that their adamant verbal opposition to drilling in
ANWR is a poor reflection of what they would do if they owned even a
small fraction of the ANWR territory containing oil."

If environmentalists owned ANWR, "they might easily conclude that
although ANWR is an 'environmental treasure,' other environmental
treasures in other parts of the country (or the world) are more
valuable. Moreover, with just a portion of the petroleum value of the
ANWR, efforts might be made to reduce the risk to other natural
habitats, more than compensating for the risks to the Arctic
wilderness associated with recovering that value."

This is not, Lee emphasizes, a recommendation to give ANWR to
environmental groups. Rather, it is a call to recognize that economic
incentives matter -- even to environmental groups. An environmental
group that refuses to put its money where its mouth is, is free to
clamor for locking up resources -- it bears no direct cost for
prohibition. One that owns resources, however, faces the reality that
wise resource ownership entails the balancing of priorities.
Unfortunately, it is the former type of environmental group has
tended to prevail.

See "To Drill or not to Drill? Let the Environmentalists Decide," by
Dwight R. Lee (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2001), at
http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink3-43-3.html.

FREEMAN, April 1999), at

-------------------------------------------------------------

GROWING RECOGNITION OF A GROWING GOVERNMENT

The irony that an administration that had trumpeted small government
and reliance on market forces now backs numerous significant
government interventions -- including huge subsidies to businesses,
IMF and World Bank funding to new allies, and far-reaching
"anti-terrorism" legislation that has civil libertarians up in arms
-- has not been lost on the national press.

In a recent article in the NEW YORK TIMES, reporter Richard W.
Stevenson reports that after years of wrangling between Republicans
and Democrats over the size and scope of the federal government, "the
two parties are more or less united now in the view that a strong
federal government with expansive powers is vital for the time being."

"Scholars say the expansion in the size and powers of the federal
government in response to the terrorist attacks is similar to what
has happened in past wars and crises," the article continues.

"'We are rushing very quickly to throw overboard announced positions
about government assistance to private enterprise, about
surveillance, about security measures of various kinds that intrude
on our liberties,' said Robert Higgs, the author of CRISIS AND
LEVIATHAN: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government.
'In that respect, this episode mirrors the great national emergencies
of our past,' Mr. Higgs said."

If, as President Bush implored the country, we must not let the
September 11 terrorist attacks change our way of life, we must resist
the impulses that have enlarged the federal government -- thus
reducing American's political and economic liberties -- every time
the nation has seen a national crisis.

Fortunately, as pop psychologists tell us, recognizing a problem is
half the challenge in correcting it. Unfortunately, special interest
groups will work to keep Americans in denial.

See "Reconciling the Demands of War and the Market," by Richard W.
Stevenson (NEW YORK TIMES, 10/28/01), at
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/28/national/28ECON.html?ex=1005313185&ei=1&en=0a21168260e411b1.

Leviathan in Twentieth-Century America: Conscription as the

Mr. Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Enron Corporation

Dear Mr. Lay:

The Earth Times/Conference News Daily has been invited to publish daily print
and Web editions at the upcoming Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Doha, November 9-13, 2001. These daily editions--which will
supplement WTO and Qatar's extraordinary efforts to ensure the success of the
meeting--will be distributed to delegates each morning at their hotels, and
also at the Doha Conference Center. As you know, this critical meeting will
consider the admission of China, and also decide on launching a new round of
trade talks. It will attract thousands of top officials from government,
industry, diplomacy, as well as media representatives.

We will also simultaneously publish daily editions in New York, as the United
Nations  General Assembly reopens its fall meeting cancelled on September 11,
and hosts heads-of-state from November 10-16. President George W. Bush will
lead world leaders in signaling a renewed drive against terrorism and launch
a new initiative to jump-start global economic growth.

Our newspaper will be the paper of record at both the WTO and General
Assembly meetings. It is guaranteed to reach all participants, many of whom
are eager readers from our coverage of major international conferences for
more than a decade, including UN gatherings and the annual meeting of the
World Economic Foorum in Davos, Switzerland. Our not-for-profit newspaper has
made a mark as an independent, nonpartisan editorial voice on international
economic, environmental and social issues. Our Chairman and Publisher is Mr.
Theodore W. Kheel, the eminent lawyer and mediator.

We plan to publish a total of ten daily editions in print and on the Web from
November 8 through 17. We would very much like to invite Enron to sponsor
these special editions either fully or in part, and to use our publication as
an effective means of conveying your position on the critical issues that
will be discussed to the audiences in Qatar and New York in a position to do
something about them. Our overall budget for both the WTO and General
Assembly meetings is US$150,000.

Enron could contribute any amount it wishes. In exchange, you will get
front-page mention each day, plus a four-color ad in every issue.

I would be most obliged for your consideration. Please be assured of the
utmost cooperation of our newspaper and myself.

With thanks again for your continuing support, and my highest personal
regards,

Yours sincerely,
Pranay
Editor-in-Chief and President

Gentleman,
Thanks for your assistance and support at the recent TFA board meeting.

In the good news department we have several items....

1.	Houston Endowment commited $200,000 payable in two installments
(June 2001 and June 2002).  Thanks to Jack Trotter for asisting with this
grant request.

2.	Letters are going out to corporate leaders following the recent
breakfast.  We thank Ken Lay, John Duncan, Scott Yeager and Jack Clark for
their assistance on the letter.  We especially thank John Duncan and Jack
Trotter for their assistance with suggested contribution amounts.
Contributions will go to support TFA activities in Houston and beyond.

3.	I was in Colorado last week.  We have successfully negotiated the
support of the Jared Polis Foundation for Technology For All-Colorado.
Jared Polis  has made a three year commitment totaling approximately
$750,000 to support TFA-Colorado as a  project o the Foundation. Mr. Polis
is a 29 year old entrepreneur who sold the online business of Blue Mountain
cards to Hallmark for around $800 million.  He is very interested in
education and technology issues and has essentially agreed to fund the work
of TFA-Colorado for at least three years as additional community support is
developed.  We will "co-brand" the web presence of TFA-Colorado with the
Foundation.

THANKS TO EACH OF YOU....

Will

I can only imagine the extreme pressure and stress you are under right now.  I just want to say that we have every confidence in you  and the management team you are forming.  WE will get through this, just as our country will get through the international situation.

Everyone needs a word of encouragement every now and then; I wanted to say we are behind you, respect you and your leadership.

We are trying to do our part in staying focused on our responsibilities, and in some small way contribute to correcting Enron's reversal of fortunes.

Thanks, Ken, for your dedication and inspiration.

After listening to your speech this morning, I am now, more than ever, proud to be an Enron Employee under your leadership.  Your commitment and fortitude under trying circumstances is always steady and going forward. During all the past years of success and truly phenomenal growth I along with my co-workers have been richly rewarded.   Not only was I rewarded economically but also my friends and superiors contributed huge amounts of time and money toward others less fortunate and able to help themselves.  

This is a direct reflection of your leadership and your giving back to the community.  This leadership by example is what will sustain us in the coming months as we build our stock back up.  I have no doubt build it up we will.  There is nothing more invigorating than a challenge to show your true courage and ambition. Shifting blame and finding scapegoats has never been your style and I am very glad to see we are not starting down that road.  I feel the up coming Chairman's Award will be a great boost to morale. 

People measure success very differently. I feel just as successful today as a year ago because I answer to a higher authority than our stock price. Enron's helping of our neighbors during the floods and the New Yorkers during their tragedies makes me very proud to work at this company.  Time is a better indicator of how well we persevered during these rather tumultuous times.  Here's to a better view in two thousand two.

I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy

Invited CE World authors,

Many of you have heard by now that ASCE is hosting the 1st Virtual World
Congress for Civil Engineering, CE World (www.ceworld.org). The
call-for-content was issued earlier this summer and the deadline for
submission was September 27, 2001. Although this deadline has passed,
we are still accepting contributions. Go to "Submit Abstracts" on the CE
World web site.


As Content Area Manager for the Geo-Technology area, I invite you to visit
their website to find out more and to submit a contribution. Most content is
expected to be in the form of papers, although you are challenged to "think
outside the box" by including other forms of media. Remember this is a
virtual conference-you do not need to attend; you visit the Congress from
the web. This is a good opportunity to show case your work without having to
travel to present it.

If you are interested in obtaining additional information on CE World, you
can contact me at jtinucci@pantechnica.com or 952-937-5879. Alternatively,
you can contact CE World Content Manager, Walter Marlowe, at
ceworld@asce.org or 703-295-6294.

I hope you will consider this invitation.

Kindest Regards,

John

Saturday, May 26, 2001 (SF Chronicle)
Enron's secret bid to save deregulation/PRIVATE MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians
Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers


   Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly
courted Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other
luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution
to California's energy crisis.
   His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and
federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.
   Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign
contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at
the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.
   Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham
Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in
1990 and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star
Schwarzenegger;
   and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have
been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.
   One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be
identified, said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting
participants to support Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who
are trying to solve the state's energy mess.
   PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION
   The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is
concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with
power markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government
authority to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last
week to create and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and
run power plants in California.
   "They're trying to rescue deregulation," the source said of Enron
executives. "They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea."
   At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position
paper titled "Comprehensive Solution for California," which was obtained
by The Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the
billions in debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that
investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are
making matters worse.
   The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway
electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power
generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by
regulators and economists.
   One of the talking points read: "Get deregulation right this time --
California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers."
Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving
electricity.
   INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS
   Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and
was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment
with a competitive power market system.
   Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially
produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from
generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this
year, Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.
   Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for
Enron, said she would "look into that" and then did not return repeated
telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at
the meeting.
   D.C. CONNECTIONS
   Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached
unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times,
Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs
regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story
also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not
support Lay's desire to further deregulate the nation's electricity
system. Lay denied the allegation.
   Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief
executive of home builder Kaufman & Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of
Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant
Amgen.
   Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles
Lakers star Earvin "Magic" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton
supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's
first civilian space trip.
   Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but
declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for
comment through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday
afternoon.
   A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor
attended,
   but was "not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this
issue.
   His intent is to listen to all sides."
   Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to
Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support
Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source
who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal
and asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his
agenda.

TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL-HOUSTON REACHES MILESTONE
100 Community Based Organizations Served since 1998
An estimated 20,000 persons now served each week

Houston, Texas  - (October 5, 2001) - Since the first installation of a
computer lab at the M.D. Anderson YMCA in May 1998, Technology For
All-Houston (TFA-Houston) has helped develop and create 100 community
technology centers (CTCs) serving Houston's underserved communities.  The
100th CTC installation is in collaboration with The Living Temple Ministries
Inc. (TLT, Inc.), a community-based organization developing a new CTC that
will serve Houston's northeast side.  TLT, Inc. will utilize the lab to
expand a workforce development initiative called the Alpha Career Center.

TLT, Inc. is a non-profit, multi-racial, faith-based organization

their proven track record of accomplishments in the community.   The
provision of computer hardware and access to TFA's suite of online software
will allow TLT, Inc. the opportunity to further its mission of  "ministering
to the total man."  Technology For All-Houston is proud to be a partner in
this effort.

Since its organization in late 1997 TFA-Houston has focused its efforts in
Houston on the development of collaborative relationships with
community-based organizations serving Houston's low-income underserved
population. With each organization TFA-Houston has helped develop a
technology and program plan that will serve the needs of the community.
Using new computers and computers redeployed from corporate donations,
TFA-Houston has worked with the organization to build a community technology
center.  Additionally, TFA-Houston brings other supportive and collaborative
relationships to each new CTC it helps develop.  These include the expertise
and online content resources provided by its parent organization Technology
For All (TFA) and others.

TFA-Houston is the local affiliate of TFA.  Together they have also
developed key supportive relationships with the Houston Technology Center,
The Telecom Opportunity Institute, Rice University, the Houston Children's
Museum and the Houston Area Technology Advisory Council of the Greater
Houston Partnership.   Each of these collaborative relationships help
provided added value to the support that TFA and TFA-Houston bring to local
grass roots organizations bringing technology to Houston's underserved
communities.

Community-based organizations assisted through the collaborative efforts of
TFA and TFA-Houston include local YMCAs, community centers, churches, faith
based social service agencies, community development organizations and
others focused on providing services to Houston's low-income underserved
communities. In addition to the M. D. Anderson YMCA, organizations assisted

between several Latino organizations and community technology centers in
underserved communities", said Technology For All President and CEO Will
Reed. "We are pleased that students and families with limited means will now
have some of the same educational opportunities that others take for
granted."

AAMA is considered one of the most successful Hispanic non-profits in the

ALLISON AND TERRORIST ATTACKS IMPACT FUNDING

Technology For All and Technology For All-Houston have both been impacted by
the important support that foundations and corporations have given to flood
relief and terrorist victim support.

To do its part, both organizations have reduced monthly operating expenses
through staff attrition, voluntary salary reductions by senior staff and
other means.  Both organizations are also working to increase both cash and
in-kind donations in an effort to weather the storm of funding reductions
brought on by the difficult events of recent months.

Ken,
Sorrry by my late answer. I am working for Enron since March of this year. I am knwing the Company and I thing that is a very good Company. Now, we are living a very difficult moment around the world and here, we have passing the worst crisis that I have known, but I thrust that next year will be better and we will be able to grow up in South America.
 
 Well, about the 5 questions that you asked, I think:

The Stock are in lowest price. My expectation is that they will increase their value. 
The PRC is very important if every people act with sincerity and if the high level of the Company use that information with criteria to acomodate the employees on the correct position according their skills. 
My moral is optimistic and I transmit the same at the other 17 employee of the Plant. I am committed with Enron and I will work with the objective to improve the performance of the business. 
Localy the image of the Company is very well. Furthermore, we permanent recomending at our employees on this matter. I am sure that the image of the Company is according the image that their employees shows inside and outside the Plant. 
Enron is a Company that have all support that any person can needs. I have had experience when I have needed anything and I have received the support and the respect of people from many places. Enron have a lot of people that are very skills in many issues and they are available to assist in any time.

Many thanks to allow to express my thought.

Best Regards,

Roberto Volont?

Asunto: Lay It On the Line Survey Results



Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:

---     A decline in the overall market and economy;

---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;

---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;

---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and

---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---     Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.

---     We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.

We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:

---     Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.

--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:

---     Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.

---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.

---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.

---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.

---     We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.

Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.

---     We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.

---     Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:

---     We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <<http://home.enron.com>>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.

--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.

---     Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.

---     We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.

---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.Message-ID: <26985671.1075852809161.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Cindy and Kathy --

The United Way Board meeting went great this morning.  The Board was
enthusiastic about the One Houston United Campaign! I think they felt the
plan was well thought out and could generate excitement as well as
contributions within the community!  They liked the idea of any funds over
$4 million going to a United Way One Houston United Restricted Fund for
future emergencies like Allison.  They voted to have the entire United Way
Board as the volunteer committee too.

Thanks so much for all you are doing on this -- your leadership is making
things happen in a BIG way!  

More later!

KEY POINTS: The Second Time Around Still Looks Good.

* ENE has cut another deal on Portland General Electric (PGE), this time with
  Northwest Natural Gas (NWN: $23.04: $1.26 Div-5.46% yield). The deal size is
  $2.955 billion. The original deal, in November 1999, was for $3.1 billion
  with Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP: $15.12: $0.80 Div: 5.29% yield). This was
  $300 mm better than we expected in our September 28 report, which upgraded
  ENE to a Strong Buy.

* This deal has very few externalities, and should close twelve months hence.
  Both companies are Oregon-based, and should get a better regulatory break
  than ENE did when it bought PGE in July 1997.

* The impact on ENE? (1) Very little gain or loss on sale of the assets; (2)
  Interest expense reductions should largely offset expected $140 mm (after
  tax) annual PGE earnings contribution; (3) A better balance sheet, with total
  leverage dropping from 61.9% to 57.3% if done today.

* This is a step in the right direction. PG&E will be in much better hands to
  pursue its Oregon agenda, and ENE will look better without PGE's presence. We
  continue to rate ENE a Strong Buy up to $36; it becomes a Buy from $36 to
  $40. Our 12-month price target is $42-$44.

Current Events:

The deal is straightforward. NWN will raise $1.55 billion in cash, $200 mm in
Feline Prides, and will issue $50 mm in NWN stock to Enron.  NWN will assume the
residual $75 mm obligation inflicted on ENE by the Oregon PUC as the price of
regulatory peace (i.e., ransom demands) at the time of the original acquisition.
This brings the total purchase price to $1.87 billion for PGE's $1.118 billion
of common equity. NWN will assume $1.05 billion of total debt and $29 mm of
straight preferreds. The price-to-book is 167%. PGE has been earning in the $125
mm-$140 mm after-tax area, although the numbers may work higher this year ($150
mm) because of FASB 133 (mark-to-market) profits on longer-dated power trading
of $16 mm being realized (so far). The approximate P/E is about 12.5x forecasts.
The electric group is now trading at 11.5x 01Es and 10.9x 02Es.

The regulatory due process should take about 12 months. There are no looming
rate cases, ROE or capital structure issues. The OPUC ranks very low among state
PUCs in terms of providing fair or competitive ROEs for investors. We were
pleased to learn that the OPUC has finally ditched the CAPM (capital asset
pricing model) as a worthless relic for determining costs of capital and has
embraced discounted cash flow methodology. The bad news was that this still
didn't prevent the OPUC from rolling over PGE in its August 1 rate case
settlement, dropping the allowed ROE from 11.6% to 10.5%. The annualized
earnings impact looks like $8-$9 mm after-tax.

Given the very parochial nature of the Oregon retail energy market, there is no
question in our mind that this should be a worthwhile deal for NWN and a win for
ENE, as well. If the deal were closed today, ENE would deleverage to the tune
of the $2.95 billion proceeds, or from 61.9% to 57.3% total leverage. It would
also trade up ENE's unnecessarily low composite ROE from the 12.5% area to
something better. PGE's secular growth rate is 3%-4% annually in rate base
terms, and its EBIT contribution would run only 8%-9% of ENE's totals in
2002-2003. There would be very little book gain or loss on the sale, and the
$1.4 billion of underlying goodwill on the PGE assets will disappear. ENE had to
reincorporate in Oregon at the time of the PGE purchase. Chances are that it
will be a Delaware corporation by this time next year.

On the other hand, NWN has seized a very good, but highly leveraged opportunity.
Both managements are largely in sync, covering much of the same ground already.
The synergies can be meaningful. NWN's asset base would more than triple, from
$1.29 billion to about $5.65 billion. In essence, NWN's $840 mm rate base will
be joined with PGE's rate base of $1.65 billion, and NWN would have tripled its
rate base to $2.49 billion. About $780 mm of goodwill will be created in the
process. NWN is funding the deal 98% with debt and a mandatory convertible
preferred, and 2% with common equity. It will set up a new upstream corporation,
and presumably do a Section 351 acquisition. The two subsidiaries will then be
merged into "NewCo", and that name will be changed back to NWN. NWN's total
capital structure at midyear ran 47.9%-3.6%-48.6% (total debt-preferreds-common
equity). The pro forma structure should run 79.7%-6.9%-13.4%. If short-term debt
is excluded, the structure becomes 77.9%-7.5%-14.6%. Each subsidiary of NewCo
will continue with about 48%-52% leverage, but the parent will look more like an
LBO. Is this bad? We don't think so, because: (1) NWN is buying $140+ mm of
earnings and may pay out about $85 mm-$90 mm in after-tax interest expense, and
thanks to FASB 140-142, there would be no goodwill amortization; (2) Newco will
have almost entirely regulated assets; and (3) the synergies in both G&A and O&M
expenses should be noticeable. The surplus CFFO/ Profitability of (say) $50-$70
mm can be used to pay down the acquisition debt. The good news is that NWN's
earnings should be ramped up significantly as a result of this deal. The
trade-off may be that this is a one-time event, and NewCO will still be subject
to the whims of the OPUC. This should not be underestimated. NWN's realized ROEs
have been about 10.0%-10.5% recently, and PGE's have been in the 12.0%-12.5%
realized range. NWN is expected to grow at 5%-6% annually, and PGE should do
3%-4% annually.

We like the deal fit, the people fit, and the collateral benefits to ENE.

Mr. Lay:
It was good to see you down on the trading floor today.  I have been in the power trading group for about a year now.  I came over from the corp. development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy.  I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.
The power trading group is a really solid group of individuals.  Sitting where I do I see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on Enron and I feel that this part of the company is doing really well.  
I have been with Enron for over four years now and I continue to learn alot as well as contribute to Enron's bottom line.  Eventhough Enron's stock price has come off a little I still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound.  I hope all is going well!

Subject:	Lay It On the Line Survey Results

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

I wanted to thank you for taking the time last Thursday to meet with us to
review the activities and Building needs of the College of Biblical Studies.
I think you got a good picture of an organization with tremendous impact on
our City and our society, yet is relatively unknown in the business
community.  Your potential leadership help with this College though your
contribution and the potential Honorary Chair we discussed could be pivotal
in bringing this unique Houston Institution into public view.  I can't think
of another way to bring disparate cultures together more meaningfully, than
to share a common belief in Christ.  We look forward to your prayerful
consideration of our requests.

On another topic, I can't tell you how pleased I was to meet your son.  He
is a wonderful man that you should be quite proud of.  Bonnie and I have  14
, 18, and 20 year old kids.....I can only hope, dream, and pray that they
turn out as well !!!

Thanks for your time and interest .... I think of what your leadership has
meant to your company and this City often, you are a great role model for
many of us.

God Bless,

KUDLOW'S TAKE
by Lawrence Kudlow


DECLARING WAR ON RECESSION
Why isn't the administration endorsing bold measures?

October 1, 2001 8:00 a.m.


Crucial to winning the global war against terrorism is a bold plan to wage
war on the domestic recession. But Washington has no such plan. Respected
policymakers look timid, cautious, and out of touch with the reality of a
declining economy. Veteran graybeards advise Congress to do nothing,
seemingly deaf to an economic call to arms.

The latest unemployment claims report ratcheted up nearly 60,000 to
450,000 - a nine-year high. This implies a huge drop in jobs and a big jump
in unemployment is on the way. A just published and miserable durable-goods
report says the technology sector is evaporating in cyberspace. Over the
three months ending in August, a composite high-tech index for shipments
dropped 50.1% at an annual rate. Technology was the biggest contributor to
the economic boom of the 1990s. Now it is the biggest drag. Even consumers
are suffering from terrorist aftershock as weekly chain-store sales are
turning negative.

Something has got to be done, but Washington isn't doing it. The Bush
administration's economic officials have been ineffectual. There is no
action-plan script, no talking points, no communication strategy. In short,
there's no leadership on the domestic economic front. The administration is
performing brilliantly in the early stages of the war against terrorism. But
thus far, it has shown no similar instincts in the war against domestic
recession.

If the domestic slump is left unattended, the nation will eventually become
demoralized. Without economic vitality at home, it will be all the more
difficult to maintain our edge overseas. Rising unemployment drains the
spirit, but we need exactly that spirit to conquer our enemies.

The economy needs a jolt. It needs risk-taking. But policymakers seem
unwilling to take risks. Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan - who keep telling
us that too much stimulus will cause inflation - are providing more
status-quo thinking at the very moment we need leaders who can size up the
current situation and then think outside the box to provide solutions.

Mr. Rubin's arguments about budget surpluses and long-term bond rates are
red herrings at best. Actually, as the recession-driven federal budget moves
into deficit, Treasury market interest rates are dropping to 40-year lows,
undercutting Rubin's entire argument on the need to maintain budget
surpluses at any economic cost. He has never understood that growth produces
surpluses, rather than the other way around. The former Clinton Treasury man
tells us that demand-side consumer tax rebates are okay while supply-side
tax cuts on successful high-end earners and capital investments are not. Go
figure. This is not economic analysis. It's a plain vanilla,
liberal-redistribution agenda.

Mr. Greenspan, meanwhile, says that capital-gains tax cuts are not the best
way to deal with the economy's short-term problem. Yet it is exactly the
deflation of capital asset values through the stock-market decline and the
deepening slump in business profits that cries out for new incentive rewards
for capital investment. Instead of pompous proclamations, let's do an
historical scrub of the after-effects of cap-gains relief. If we do, it will
show that faster economic growth, rising stock markets, and stronger budget
revenues always follow lower tax-rates on capital investment.

Jack Kemp and Sen. Zell Miller have it exactly right in their editorial
proposal to slash cap gains, accelerate the depreciation of investment in
plant, equipment, and technology, and make the phased-in personal tax-rate
reductions effective immediately. Their monetary view that the Federal
Reserve should abandon its interest rate target in favor of larger emergency
cash injections is also correct.

So, why aren't administration economists endorsing these bold measures? Why
aren't they making the case that it's business that creates jobs, and that
business desperately needs a fresh capital infusion? No amount of consumer
tax rebates will stop the unemployment rate from rising if capital-starved
and profit-losing businesses don't get immediate relief from a permanent
reduction of tax-rates. Bush policymakers should also make the case that the
twin crises of war and recession will require a temporary budget deficit of
roughly 1.5% of GDP ($150 billion) to finance tax-cuts, defense, and
infrastructure-rebuilding policies that are necessary to re-ignite economic
growth.

The public is four-square behind the president in the global war against
terrorism. It will also stand four-square behind the president in the war
against recession. Indeed, the public knows that a strong domestic economy
is vital to the war effort. Since President Bush's spectacular speech
rallying the nation for the global war against terrorism, the Dow Jones
stock index has appreciated 7%, or roughly 600 points. If the president
rallies the nation with a war plan to end recession, the market will rise
exponentially, signaling economic recovery and the revival of the American
spirit.

Cindy/Ken:

Just checking to see if Enron Community Relations/Lay Foundation has additi=
onal questions regarding Community Partners' request (described below) for =
immediate Stabilization/Transition Funding of $25,000 this year and a long-=
term commitment of $100,000 over several years.  I would be glad to visit w=

Subject:=09Community Partners' Stabilization/Transition Campaign

Misha and Jennifer:  Thanks for visiting with me this week regarding Commun=
ity Partners and our ongoing campaign.  Give me a call so I can schedule a =
tour for you two.
Cindy:  I regret that you were unable to join us but I did want to include =
you in this follow-up email requested by Misha and Jennifer, and to invite =
you to a tour of our clinic.

Background:   As you know, Enron (the old HNG) was a founding member of Com=
munity Partners (once known as Urban Affairs Corp.) and has been an on-goin=
g contributor to the non-profit for all of its 25+ year history.  Begun as =
an effort by the business community in Houston to increase the number of fe=
male minorities in the workforce by providing low-cost daycare to children =
of inner-city mothers, Community Partners has grown into a $2+ million annu=
al budget organization whose emphasis now is school-based health clinics.  =
These clinics, including a mobile clinic operated in cooperation with Episc=
opal Health Charities and Christ Cathedral-downtown, are utilized by the UT=
-Health Sciences and UT Nursing Schools as teaching facilities for their st=
udents, interns and residents, and as a result,  we are able to offer a ful=
l-year of unlimited health care at a cost of approximately $100 per individ=
ual served -- a significant savings when compared to costs associated with =
government programs at charity hospitals.  Our associated childcare facilit=
y housed in an HISD school adjacent to our main clinic allows young school-=
age mothers to remain in school by providing care for infants and pre-schoo=
lers while the students attend classes.

Prior Giving History:  For the first 15-20 years of its existence, Enron hi=
storically made an annual $25,000 contribution to the non-profit and in the=
 last 10-years has annually purchased a $10,000 table at the Fathers of the=
 Year Luncheon, which has become a one of Houston's most recognized luncheo=
n fund-raisers.  Ken Lay has been honored and has served in numerous years =
as Honorary Chairman of the event, and he and his foundation normally buys =
a $25,000 table.   When EOG was an Enron subsidiary, Forrest Hoglund, chair=
ed the event one year and the Hoglund Foundation has been a regular contrib=
utor.   Enron's Adopt-a-Child Holiday Program actually got its start in ass=
ociation with Community Partners when Enron employees would adopt and buy g=
ifts for children in our childcare centers.  Over the last several years, E=
nron's contribution has been reduced to a $10,000 annual table purchase ass=
ociated with the Fathers of the Year Luncheon.

Update on Community Partners:  After serving on the Board for 15+ years (tw=
o years as Chairman), the one thing I have learned about a non-profit like =
Community Partners is that there is never much surplus cash, especially at =
year-end, and we are always waiting for that next contribution.  Every year=
 we have been able to squeeze by, but this year, because of a number of cir=
cumstances, Community Partners is in a severe battle for survival.  Because=
 of personal health problems experienced by Executive Director Donna Bryant=
, her husband, Don, and son, Jason, the Board earlier this year decided to =
acquire the services of a fund-raising consulting group headed by Harriet L=
attimer and Tom Herren to help us through this crisis and to make recommend=
ations.  The Board overwhelmingly endorsed their recommendations which incl=
uded the following:
Promoting Donna Bryant to a Chairman Emeritus position with continued salar=
y over the next three years.  Donna would have no day-to-day duties, which =
will allow her to take care of her own health needs and to transition to re=
tirement.  She would be called on only, as needed, on a consulting basis.  =
=20
Seeking $500,000 in immediate transition/stabilization support from certain=
 foundations who have voiced interest in providing that support to keep thi=
s important program going.  (Grant requests of $250,000 each have been subm=
itted to the Meadows Foundations and the Cullen Foundation.)
Beginning an immediate search for an Executive Director (with the enthusias=
tic assistance of Jackie Martin and her United Way staff) and to consider t=
he hiring of a Development Director to focus on fundraising.   FYI:  I talk=
ed with Roy Hughes and have forwarded his resume to the Board search commit=
tee.
Refocusing of the Houston Endowment $150,000 annual grant to the clinics an=
d requesting immediate payment.  (Accomplished)=20
Strengthening of the Board of Directors.  (I have agreed to chair the Nomin=
ating Committee so any ideas you can contribute would be appreciated.)
Reapplying for United Way membership.  (We once were a UW agency but Donna =
did not like the limitations to fundraising  ... under the current circumst=
ances, the Board now thinks otherwise.)
Beginning an immediate personal Board contribution campaign and to seek sta=
bilization funding this year from the Houston community, both from corporat=
ions and individuals.   (Already underway.)
Consider a major endowment campaign next year to provide emergency cash flo=
w in times when we are waiting for the foundation checks to come in.

Enron's Role??:  In addition to an immediate stabilization gift of $25,000 =
to $50,000 to help us through the remainder of the year, we would appreciat=
e the consideration of a major gift in the $100,000+ range over a 3-5 year =
period for the Endowment Campaign.   We would also like a top Enron executi=
ve (Ken Lay would be nice, but it could be a nice intro to the Community fo=
r Mark Frevert or Greg Whalley) to consider chairing the Endowment Campaign=
 once it gets organized next year.  I would also consider stepping down fro=
m the Board to allow a more high-level executive to represent us on the Boa=
rd.

I apologize for the long-winded nature of this message, but I wanted to mak=
e sure that everyone knew all the facts.   Thanks for your consideration.=

Dear Ken,

I hope you are faring okay in these difficult times.  At Aspen ISIB, our
work goes forward, albeit with much discussion about how to stay relevant
and to understand the connections between social impact management and
aftermath of September 11th.

I have a request of you.  An example of work that we think has great
relevance is a by-invitation only meeting of about 30 experts in Executive
Education--as practiced by corporations, by universitites and professional
service firms--that we are convening near Washington D.C in November.  It's
a
two day working session, and the title is "Balanced Leadership During
Turbulence and Crisis: The Role of Executive Education."  We had planned to
focus more specifically on the economic downturn, but for obvious reasons
have broadened the scope of the discussions.  This work, like the Aspen
Business Leaders Dialogue, builds on two meetings that have preceded this
one, and we benefit from including a mix of "returnees" and new
participants.

I am writing to find out if there is someone in your firm that would make a
contributuion to the discussion and would like the opportunity to reflect on
best practice and innovation in executive education and training as we
consider the need for extraordinary leaders in our global enterprises. The
meeting is about the balancing act--profits vs. principles, short vs.
long-term needs, and listening to multiple stakeholders. If you have any
ideas for us, please let me know.  Nancy McGaw, who runs the meeting, or I
will follow up. A one-page description is attached for your convenience. The
Co-Chairs of the meeting are Bill Wiggenhorn, until recently President of
Motorola University, now of Providian Financial, and Gary Jusela, Chief
Learning Officer at Lucent Technologies.

Best regards, Judy

Judith Samuelson

Dear Ken:

It was great to see you in Denver.  The group of  leaders from the Western
Governors' Association and major businesses  were energized to take control
of their destiny, and your ideas contributed enormously.  I think that you
and I are very much on the same page regarding the President's Energy Report
and the opportunities that it presents.  In addition, Joe Romm and I have
worked  a bit with the Enron Energy Services team on some initial ways to
highlight and quantify the "green" aspects of the EES product.  You are well
positioned to prove what initiatives bring both business and
energy/environmental benefits.

Per our discussion, I have attached below a copy of a confidential
preliminary report on the potential for a "Cooler Houston" initiative.  The
scientific models relating to "urban heat island effects" indicate that
planting trees, lightening the color of roofs and resurfacing pavement with
lighter material can reduce ambient high temperatures in Houston and thus
potentially lead to ozone reductions far cheaper than the cost of the "last
mile" tons indicated in current SIP efforts.  Success requires developing
some technical agreement and common cause among U.S. EPA, TNRCC, the City of
Houston, and business and civic leaders in the City.  Bill White and the
leadership of the Greater Houston Partnership have been spearheading early
work on this.  Our team is working with U.S. EPA and TNRCC to see if they
can agree on the models.

 We would be very interested in your ideas on this.  Moreover, if the
technical people can agree in concept, we would value your support of an
achievable Cooler Houston plan going forward.  Naturally, the plan is
exciting because it offers economic, air quality and broader quality-of-life
benefits to the Houston community.  Ever since we developed the acid rain
trading program, I have enjoyed promoting such ideas!

Please let me know anything else that you need.  I hope to see you soon.  In
the meantime, best wishes to you and the family.

Sincerely,

Hank Habicht

NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS LIKELY TO FEED GOVERNMENT GROWTH

Military and economic crises have been the twin engines propelling
the growth of American government, as politicians have rushed through
new spending programs and regulations to show the public that they
were "doing something." When the crises passed, however, government
didn't revert to its pre-crisis size. Instead, the expansions created
new baselines for further government growth, according to Independent
Institute senior fellow Robert Higgs in his book CRISIS AND LEVIATHAN.

This "ratchet effect" is of special concern in the aftermath of the
Sept. 11th attacks, as Congress gave the executive branch broad
powers intended to fight terrorism and prop up a faltering economy,
according to Higgs in an interview with REASON Magazine.

"When the government takes large-scale, unprecedented actions of this
sort, unanticipated consequences always occur," says Higgs. "Then the
government has to expand even further to deal with those
consequences."

"The ultimate result will be an enlargement of the Big Brother state.
We were moving that way already. This will accelerate it," Higgs
concludes.

http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink3-38-1.html.

-------------------------------------------------------------

HOW THE FEDS MISREPRESENTED ANTI-PRIVACY PROVISIONS OF 1994 LAW

Congress is now contemplating passage of the Mobilization Against
Terrorism Act, which would (among other things) expand government
wiretapping and eavesdropping powers.

Unknown to most Americans, however, is that Congress had already
given law enforcement authorities broad powers to expand electronic
surveillance in the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law
Enforcement Act (CALEA), according to political economist Charlotte
Twight in the fall 2001 issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW.

Among other powers, the CALEA gave the Federal Bureau of
Investigation authority to track the physical location of cell phone
users and to obtain the content of private communications in a
variety of circumstances without a probable-cause warrant. Yet when
testifying to Congress about the proposed CALEA, the FBI's
then-director Louis Freeh repeatedly claimed that CALEA would confer
no new authority on law enforcement officials, provide no information
about the physical location of cellular phone calls, and not weaken
existing privacy protections.

The CALEA episode, argues Twight, demonstrates that Congress is no
match for crafty machinations of bureaucrats expert in masking their
true intentions by hamstringing Congress's ability to understand the
meaning of new legislation -- what Twight calls an example of the
manipulation of "political transaction costs," such as the cost of
understanding the details of legislation.

"The confluence of CALEA, federally mandated electronic databases of
personal information, Carnivore, Digital Storm, Echelon, and the like
have established a web of federal surveillance never before known in
the United States," writes Twight.

"One way or another, we will soon learn that the
resistance-inhibiting power of broad-based government surveillance is
potentially the most liberty-endangering form of political
transaction-cost manipulation confronting Americans -- and
freedom-loving people everywhere -- in the new millennium."

See "Conning Congress: Privacy and the 1994 Communications Assistance
for Law Enforcement Act" by Charlotte Twight (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW,
Fall 2001), at

Americans" by Charlotte Twight (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 1999),

THE DRUG WAR ON TRIAL: Independent Policy Forum Transcript Now Available

Many public officials fear political reprisals if they speak out
against the "War on Drugs," but judges James Gray (Orange County,
Calif., Superior Court) and Vaughn Walker (U. S. District Court, San
Francisco, Calif.), not only testified against it at the recent
Independent Policy Forum, "The Drug War on Trial: Two Judges Speak
Out," they also explained why an increasing number of judges are
joining them.

Judge Gray began by explaining how his years as a criminal prosecutor
led him to write his recent book, WHY OUR DRUG LAWS HAVE FAILED AND
WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. Despite the vast sums poured into drug
interdiction and prosecution, Judge Gray explained, he observes that
drugs are no harder to obtain today than when he was prosecuting drug
cases. Further, drugs today are often more dangerous because
anti-smuggling efforts and anti-marijuana laws have led drug dealers
to supply drug users with more potent drugs.

Judge Walker explained that the growing number of judges opposing the
Drug War are diverse in their political orientation and career
experience. But, he said, the judges cannot be the sole advocates of
sensible drug-law reform -- citizens in every walk of life must
become better informed about the Drug War's tremendous economic,
social and health costs, and voice their objections in public.

Is serious reform possible on so emotional a topic? Yes, measured
optimism is warranted, according to the judges. Just as communism in
Eastern European collapsed quickly and unexpectedly, so may the War
on Drugs, as Americans learn of better approaches to dealing with
drug abuse, such as those practiced in Switzerland, Judge Gray
concluded.

Mr. Lay,
	
	I am trying to gather a list of FUMC members that work at Enron. Right now, you are my only source.  The Membership manager has no "Work" field to query the members.  I'd like to take advantage of the Enron Matching Program to raise money for the recent tragedy.  I am a member of the Crosstrainers (young singles) group and we are organizing a fundraiser and need extra money for the entertainment.  The Enron donations will go directly towards the NY & Washington tragedies.  Please see the attachment.

Please let me know any FUMC members that work at Enron.  I would like to notify them of the opportunity to come together to match contributions for fundraisers through FUMC.  Thanks so much for your help.

Respectfully yours,

Shelley Johnson

Family and Friends,
I just received this e-mail from a  girlfriend of mine and wanted to share =
her first hand accounts with you.   It put a lump in my throat and brought =
tears to my eyes.  I ache for those  people, all people, our nation and our=
 world.  May God bless you, and  may you feel blessed each and every day by=
 his presence!  =20
Love,
Robyn

Hi,
First, let me thank you again  for your thoughts and concerns. =20
I did make it out of the city for a  long weekend and truly got to unwind. =
 Many people out in the Hamptons are  contributing to the cause in several =
ways and like the rest of the country the  mood is somber. However, life is=
 still beautiful there.  I rode my bicycle  everyday, canoed, walked on the=
 beach and went to interesting dinners.  But  then I came back.  The bus I =
was on was stopped and searched before  entering the Midtown tunnel, which =
leads into the city.   Everyone,  including the driver was asked for pictur=
e ID.  I came back because Monday  evening started the Jewish New Year and =
I had dinner with my family in the city.   After dinner, my brother-in-law,=
 my cousin (visiting from Israel) and I  went downtown to ground zero.  It =
is off limits to anyone other than the  military, firefighters and the poli=
ce, but I got this unique opportunity to  enter the belly of the beast beca=
use my friend who has a restaurant down in  Tribeca set up a hot meal zone =
in one of the damaged buildings.  He and his  staff are the only non offici=
als allowed there.  I went to help serve.   Getting down was a struggle in =
itself.  I passed through many  blockades guarded by the military, and fina=
lly had a police escort get me all  the way down.  No matter how I describe=
 what I saw, I couldn't possibly  give an accurate picture of the devastati=
on.  The only thing I can tell you  is that it is so much larger in life.  =
The piece of facade of one of the  towers that you have seen on the news an=
d in all the papers spans one full city  block.  There were firefighting cr=
ews from California, Ohio, Indiana and  more.  I spoke with many.=20
Yesterday I went to synagogue.  The  experience was intense.  We waited on =
a line that went around the block  before going through metal detectors to =
get in.  I sat next to a Managing  Director of Cantor Fitzgerald, who was l=
ate to work on Tuesday.  He lost  all 200 of his staff as well as 500 who d=
id not work directly for him.  The  woman in front of me lost her son.  We =
had several firefighters visit the  temple and, as you can imagine, they wa=
lked into a full five minutes of cheers  and applause.  It was so touching.=
  No dry eyes.
I realize I'm  rambling but thought you might be interested in a first hand=
 account.
All  my best to you,
Joyce

Subject: FW: With love from Oslo


We received this very touching message from the recently retired CFO of one
of the firm's clients.  The letter was authored by a British woman who lived
in Houston with her Norwegian husband for many years.


Dear friends:
It's almost midnight on Wednesday evening in Oslo, and I have just come home
from a walk down to the American Embassy, where I added my flowers and
candles to those already there.  I'd like to describe it to you:

* A perfect evening, very dark, but lots of stars, around 60 degrees, not a
breath of  wind.
* On one side of the street the embassy itself, where they were hard at work
adding a second row of concrete barriers.
* On the other side of the street, in front of the railings alongside the
palace grounds, a hundred yards or so of outpourings of sympathy from the
people of Oslo:
* Thousands of candles, all sizes, some standing alone, others arranged in
patterns - hearts, crosses, the letters USA.
* Bouquets of flowers of all kinds, from the simplest wildflowers to
beautiful bouquets.
* An exquisite wreath from the firefighters of Oslo.
* Norwegian and American flags
* Letters and cards in many languages.  Messages of hope, love, sympathy -
and outrage.
* Children's paintings and drawings - some depictng the horror of the plane
about to hit the tower with childlike simplicity, others showing children on
their knees praying for God to give America comfort.
* A placard with the words "The Atlantic is a creek, our sympathy is an
oceen, America is the world."
* Many, many people of all ages, walking slowly, reading the cards and
letters, and adding their own contributions.
* Not a sound to be heard, except for that of people trying to control their
tears.

It was extraordinarily beautiful, and incredibly moving.  I think it was the
utter silence that was the most powerful aspect.  The silence of grief and
mind-numbing outrage.

I thought you would like to know.

God bless you.

Love, Jan

Subject:	Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy


The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on "Disaster Relief"  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of "National Prayer and Remembrance," and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Ken and Greg:

Prior to your potential meeting on Wednesday, I just wanted to get my two cents in with respect to Heath Schiesser and the Xlerator.

I vote in favor of supporting the Xlerator based on a few rationales:
First and foremost, Heath is a quality player - with a unique set of skills that would contribute to Enron's human capital;
The discipline that the Xlerator would bring to new businesses, in and of itself, probably justifies its existence:  for example, I believe that the investment in AMPS approaches $20 million - much of which is at risk due to inadequate discipline; and
The Xlerator appears to be a low cost R&D option of relatively limited size while compared to Enron - that may very well incubate businesses which create meaningful value for Enron.
At the same time, I acknowledge the costs, both financial and resources, and risks but feel the above benefits are greater.

Although support from the Management Committee would be nice, I believe that support from you two would provide the foundation upon which Heath and the Xlerator can be successful.

Greetings Technology For All Board Members:

Several of you have seen the announcement today that Enron received notice
from Dynegy, Inc. that it is terminating the merger aggreement between it
and Enron.  In addition, Standard and Poor's, Moody Investors Service and
Fitch, Inc. downgraded Enron's long-term debt to below investment grade.

Technology For All has been the recipient of significant support from Enron
as a national sponsor.  We are grateful for Enron's support and the support
of Ken Lay.  We acknowledge the enormous credibilty that support has given
us to expand our vision and mission.  We now have direct supportive
relationships with 200+ Community Technology Centers in 15 U.S. cities
including our local TFA affiliates in Houston, Denver and Cleveland, Ohio.
We estimate that 30,000-50,000 persons each week are positively impacted by
these program partnerships.

With the Enron announcements today in the press, I wanted to inform you of
my actions in response to these developments.

Enron's commitment to Technology For All was a commitment of three items
over three years: Cash, Connectivity on the Enron Network and in-kind
contributions of hardware and/or other services.
The commitment was to expire at the end of 2002. Therefore, 2/3 of the cash
commitment has been received by TFA. We have received some in-kind
contributions, but never finalized the provision of connectivity on the
Enron Network. To date, continuing connectivity has generously been provided
by FYI-Net, a privately owned company of which Scott Yeager and members of
his family are the largest stockholders.  Therefore, while significant to
TFA, the Enron developments will not shutdown our vital mission to bring
technology to underserved communities.  Our vision continues to be focused
on using technology as a tool with the disadvantaged and underserved to
bring about sustainable and meaningful change in their communities.

Over the past several weeks as Enron situation has unfolded, we have done
and are doing several things to preserve our core missional focus.

1)  In expectation of reduced revenue, we have been cutting expenses
significantly and will be announcing several layoffs in the next few days.
I have taken a voluntary 10% reduction in income and Douglas Caldwell has
taken a voluntary 5% reduction in income.

2)  With the assistance of a "Capacity Building" tool developed by McKinsey
& Co. for the Venture Philanthropy Partners Group out of Washington DC., we
are in the midst of strategic planning effort that will help us rewrite our
business plan.  This effort will help us focus on the capacity building
activities most vital to our core mission and develop a "go forward" plan.

3)  We are intensely developing other relationships with corporate and
foundation funders that are project specific and results oriented.   Almost
all of my time will be focused on fund raising activites.  We have several
potential relationships under development. The diversification of our donor
basis is criticial to the future of our mission. To set an example for
potential donors, in addition to the reduction in salary, my 2001 gifts to
TFA equal 1% of my annual income.

4)  I have named Douglas Caldwell to serve in an expanded position of
leadership as the Chief Operating Officer. As the COO, Douglas now has
responsibility and authority for the day-to-day operations of Technology For
All and also for Technology For All-Houston. This decision was made in
consultation with Jack Trotter, Scott Yeager and Jack Clark.   As some of
you already know, Douglas brings many skills to this new role. In addition
to his numerous contacts with potential funding sources, he is able to see
the big picture of our common vision while at the same time is also able to
drill down to the details required to accomplish it.  He is also a person
who manages resources well.  While this is always important, this is
especially important during this time of economic uncertainty.  We must be
good stewards of our available resources.

5.	It is my recomendation to the TFA Board that we establish advisory
boards in each TFA city and at the national level to help carry the TFA
banner and to raise the dollars necessary to support our core programs and
activies.  The TFA-Houston Board of Directors unanimously affirmed this
recomendation for Houston.  I solicit your support of this recomendation on
a national level and your suggestions of persons who may be potential
advisory board members.

6.	We are in the final stages of preparation for a larger three year
proposal for a Houston Workforce Development Initiative that will utilize
our SmartForce content in collaboration with over 100 of our community
program partners.  It is our intent to pitch this first to Houston's Brown
Foundation for a three year commitment. The support of our board will be
vital to the success of this proposal.  Mr. Valenti, I will be calling you
and others to assist with this.

Please call me if you have any questions regarding my plans.  I look forward
to your comments and reflections.

Regards,

Will

Ken,  Thanks for your message.  Communication, even if it is brief, from yo=
u is absolutely critical at this time.  While Enron has a very tough road a=
head, I think I can speak for several people on my team that we are support=
ive of the non-Dynegy route regardless of the option we ultimately plan to =
pursue.  I know the best thing I can do for Enron is to sell our remaining =
assets to either BG or another counter party.  I am committed to this task =
and we will continue to focus on BG, but we need to be prepared that it may=
 be necessary to take a different path to sell the India E&P assets.  In a =
strange way, the termination of the Dynegy merger may actually help the E&P=
 sale because it takes away the automatic loss of operatorship ONGC was usi=
ng as leverage.  Depending on Enron Corp.'s plans, we may have a much stron=
ger message to play with our Indian partners and the GOI.  They should be c=
oncerned that we will keep ownership and operatorship long term, and they s=
hould also be concerned that we will not want to spend the capital to expan=
d the projects (something the GOI/ONGC really wants to do).  After you anno=
unce Corp's plan, I will go to India and meet with our partners and the GOI=
 in this regard.     =20

Based on your note below and earlier comments, I know the trading business =
is a key component to your future core operations.  I am supportive of that=
 decision because I saw the enormous value it can generate in the right cir=
cumstances.  As I have mentioned before, I think the company should sell bu=
sinesses such as the E&P company that are non-core.  It is the right thing =
to do, especially in these circumstances.  However, some of the non-core bu=
sinesses generate good cashflow (like the E&P company) and we have to be ca=
reful in this environment to make sure the company supports the "valuable" =
non-core businesses until they can be monetized. =20

I also know most of your senior advisors are disciples of the trading  busi=
ness.  Because they grew up in that environment, they are very comfortable =
and knowledgeable of this business model and there will be tremendous press=
ure to maintain certain trading activities or people for the future even wh=
en the near-term value is questionable.  I hope somebody at the table asks =
the question, if we focus our limited financial resources to maintain this =
future benefit, have we lost a "valuable near-term non-core" resource?  I k=
now these decisions are not easy or clear-cut,  but in this new paradigm th=
is could happen pretty easily since most of the players at the table do not=
 understand Enron's non-core businesses or what it takes to optimize near-t=
erm value. This comment is not intended to offend anybody, but it is a conc=
ern.

For example,  Enron made financial commitments of $10.5 million to our staf=
f to maintain operations and sell our assets.  We've sold everything except=
 EOGIL and we have negotiated mutually acceptable PSA's with two different =
companies for EOGIL, but due to some extra-ordinary circumstances, this has=
 proven to be a tough sale.  As I mentioned in the first paragraph, I think=
 we can get there, but it may take a little more time and we need to mainta=
in staff during the interim.=20

I recognize everything has changed due to recent events.  I am not asking f=
or a handout because that is the way it was before or anything like that.  =
My point is the company will have to make tough decisions regarding which i=
ndividuals to incentivize and I believe the existing commitments to the E&P=
 team should be maintained even though this is a non-core business.  Reaffi=
rming the company's commitment to the $10.5 million will give us a good pro=
bability of keeping enough of the core staff to achieve our goals and monet=
ize the assets soon. I recognize that $10.5 million is not a trivial sum of=
 money, but without these individuals we stand to lose $50 to $100 million =
in the next 12 months; therefore, I have believe this is the right decision=
 for Enron.

I believe EGEP is one of the "valuable" non-core businesses, but if this be=
comes a point of controversy I would at least like the opportunity to prese=
nt my case in person to one of you.=20

Thanks for taking the time to read my note.=20
Jeff

As you have heard, Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today.  Among=
 other things, this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives - wh=
ich we are actively doing.  As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal =
- and now Dynegy's announcement - Enron's debt was downgraded to below inve=
stment grade levels today by S&P, Moody's and Fitch. =20

In response to this action, we have initiated a plan to protect value in ou=
r core trading and other energy businesses.  At the same time, we are neari=
ng the completion of the business review process announced last week.  Once=
 this process is complete, we will be conducting a comprehensive restructur=
ing of our business.  Regrettably, but unavoidably, this will include the s=
ale of non-core assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost savin=
g plan, including layoffs.=20

We are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value =
of our core businesses, retaining our employees who are key to our future s=
uccess, and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties.  Thi=
s must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of En=
ron.

I know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you.  Althou=
gh, there are no guarantees, you should know that we are still in this figh=
t and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing bu=
sinesses of Enron.  All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each othe=
r, stay focused on our work as best we can, and stick together while we wor=
k to overcome these latest challenges.

Even six or so weeks ago, none of us could have imagined that we would be w=
here we are today.  We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost, but=
 we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company.  As always,=
 I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make.  Thank you.

RE: Houston Mayor's Race - The Home Stretch 
Orlando Sanchez is locked in a tough run-off election, and he needs your help now to cross the finish line strong and become Houston's next mayor. 
In case you haven't heard, both Presidents Bush have endorsed Orlando for Mayor, and HUD Secretary Mel Martinez and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao will be in Houston to help campaign for Orlando.  That's all great news for the Sanchez Campaign, but what will matter most is that Houstonians turn out at the polls this Saturday and help Orlando finish strong and finish first! 
If you're a Houstonian, your vote, your financial support and your volunteer efforts are needed most.  Remember, the election is THIS SATURDAY (12/1/01). 
The rest of us can lend a hand to Orlando Sanchez by making a contribution to his campaign today and by encouraging our friends, family and business associates in Houston to go to the poll and cast a vote for real leadership for America's fourth largest city! 
Please take a moment right now and make a contribution to Orlando's campaign online at https://www.campaigncontribution.com/donors_info.asp?id=1932&db=1 .  Or, mail your contribution to Orlando Sanchez Campaign, 3100 Timmons Lane, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77027. 
Or, equally important, volunteer to help Orlando turn out the vote.  Jump to the "Get Involved" 
section of his web site at http://www.orlandosanchez.com/get_involved.htm . 
Please forward this message along to as many of your friends, family and co-workers as possible.  The run-off election is just a few short days away.  Please do what you can to help ensure Orlando finishes strong and finishes first on December 1.

Ken

I know it has been several years since we spoke, but I wanted to thank you =
for your kind note, and to personally thank you for the opportunities that =
Enron has provided to me over the years.

I am one of those few who was already with HNG in 1984, and still vividly r=
emember the day that you arrived.  The building was immediately permeated b=
y a sense of urgency and excitement.  That pace was relentless - and addict=
ive.  I also remember in detail the Internorth merger in 1985, and feel pro=
ud to have played a part, however small it was, in that transaction.

The late 1980's and the early 1990's will probably always be my favorite ye=
ars of my working life.  There were so many initiatives in Enron in their i=
nfancy.  Although it was an initiative that faced insurmountable economics =
and ultimately failed, I am grateful that Enron gave me the opportunity to =
participate in the natural gas vehicle adventure.  I never really understoo=
d until that adventure the full meaning of the old axiom that the lessons l=
earnt best are those learnt from adversity and from making mistakes!!

I will try to remember Enron with those years through the mid-1990's in min=
d.  I have to say that I consider those to be the best years, because I hav=
e witnessed a degradation of the corporate culture in the past few years.  =
That is clearly a subjective assessment, and should be treated as such.  I =
am under no illusions:  Enron is a business entity operating in markets and=
 environments that are relentlessly competitive, with a primary responsibil=
ity to its shareholders.  But I and many of my colleagues who also have lon=
g tenure at Enron and its predecessors share this assessment.  I am always =
amused by the irony of the stated value "Ruthlessness, callousness and arro=
gance do not belong here", since these appear to be the key defining person=
al characteristics of most of the senior management of ENA in recent years.

And unfortunately, the very sale of HPL by Enron has been for some an examp=
le of the degradation of corporate culture.  For myself, I know what to exp=
ect - I know that with corporate divestitures comes the need to control inf=
ormation as the transaction evolves.  But for the "rank and file" - those w=
ho live from paycheck to paycheck - it has not been a pleasant experience. =
 They maintained their professionalism (indeed many of them probably worked=
 harder than anybody else to make the transaction happen).  In return, ther=
e has been an appalling lack of timely information and misinformation from =
Enron management and HR department with respect to their benefits and caree=
r choices.  HR in particular has been totally non-responsive to individual =
inquiries in the past few months - not returning phone calls and emails fro=
m HPL employees with questions, even after the transaction was announced.  =
Even as recently as the past couple of days, only upon receipt of their ter=
mination packages did several dozen employees discover that they had been m=
isinformed by HR with respect to some aspects of their remaining Enron bene=
fits.

For myself, my years at Enron will remain a high point of my career.  It is=
 a badge of honor in the energy industry to have been a dealmaker at Enron,=
 particularly for as many years as I was there.  I know Enron will continue=
 to set the standards by most measures in this industry, and, for what its =
worth, I humbly wish you continued success.

Thanks

Subject:=09Thank You

I want to take this opportunity before the transfer of Houston Pipeline Com=
pany assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you f=
or your teamwork and success in our years together.

Some of you were here when I joined your company in 1984, but many of you a=
rrived during the Enron era and might not know the full story of my arrival=
.  I was president of Transco Energy at the time and was probably in line t=
o be the chairman.  I did not expect to ever join another energy company.  =
Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management team wa=
s needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry enviro=
nment.  The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company wo=
uld be a good platform from which to make major changes.  And the results o=
ver the last 17 years could not have been better.

Houston Pipeline Company has been a major contributor to developing Enron i=
nto what it is today.  Your professionalism, ideas, dedication and commitme=
nt toward this company have been instrumental in making our success possibl=
e.  For this, you will not only be a critical part of Enron's history, but =
you will also always deserve Enron's gratitude.

I wish you nothing but the very best in your next endeavors, even as I am s=
ure you will not need my good luck wishes.  As always, your professionalism=
 and dedication will be your best allies when facing new challenges and opp=
ortunities.

Sincerely,

IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE:
1. The Federal Bureau of Incompetence
2. Integrating Immigrants
3. Happy Birthday, Patrick Henry

-------------------------------------------------------------

THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INCOMPETENCE

The American people justifiably feel sickened by the FBI's
mishandling of evidence in the Timothy McVeigh case, but they
shouldn't be surprised, according to economist Bruce Benson, senior
fellow at The Independent Institute.

"The FBI's failure to divulge reams of evidence to McVeigh's lawyers
is just the latest bungle in a history stretching back to when
President Theodore Roosevelt created its predecessor, the Bureau of
Investigation," writes Benson in a new op-ed.

"Regrettably, blunders and cover-ups are not confined to the FBI.
Despite cover-up attempts, similar scandals involving both state and
local prosecutors and police show that misrepresentation and even
falsification of forensic evidence occurs regularly."

At the root of the systemic problems that plague public
law-enforcement, Benson argues, is poor accountability. Yet strong
accountability (and its offshoot, innovation) is the norm in the
private sector. This, according to Benson, explains why governments
are increasingly contracting with the private sector for police
dispatch, investigative services, fingerprinting, crime labs, traffic
control, data processing, prisoner transport and other traditional
police functions. Between 1964 and 1997, in fact, the number of
specialized security firms grew by more than 800 percent, while
employment by these firms grew by almost 925 percent.

This trend is explained by the simple fact that in police services,
as in other services, customers tend to get what they pay for. For
example:

* In 1992, the 2,565 private railroad police employed by major
railroads had a clearance rate (reported crimes cleared by arrest)
2.86 times greater than the clearance rate for public police.

* In the 1970s, a private investigation firm was contracted to look
into police corruption in small towns in Ohio and West Virginia.
Within months, the firm's efforts led to more than 150 arrests.

* After a drug scandal in 1993, the town of Sussex, New Jersey,
replaced its tiny four-officer police force with private policing
firm. Contracting out for policing is a common practice in
Switzerland and the Bahamas.

"Calls on Congress to once again investigate the FBI miss the mark,"
concludes Benson. "Changing the political and bureaucratic delivery
of policing services requires fundamental reform, and the growth of
the private security industry strongly suggests how those reforms
ought to take shape."

A Return to Privatized Police Services," at

INTEGRATING IMMIGRANTS

The best way for state governments to help integrate immigrants into
American life is to promote private schooling, according to Alex
Tabarrok, research director at The Independent Institute.

In his testimony before the State of California's Little Hoover
Commission, Tabarrok argued that private schooling is the most
effective way to foster proficiency in the English language -- the
single most important skill for immigrants to learn.

California's public high schools, Tabarrok noted, have appalling
student dropout rates: 32 percent overall and about 45 percent for
immigrants. Dropout rates for similar students are much lower in
private schools. California's public schools also have little room
for educational diversity, experimentation or competition. In the
heated debate over bilingual education, no one questioned why
politicians, bureaucrats and voters should decide a question best
left to parents and educators. Private education is much better at
matching students with teaching styles and curricula best suited to
their individual needs.

Private schools are a benefit to native students as well as
immigrants. Lower dropout rates and greater college attendance for
natives reduces potential conflicts in the labor market between
low-skilled natives and immigrants.

Tabarrok also called for repealing laws and regulations that impede
entrepreneurship among immigrants, such as city regulations that have
eroded jitney services often run by immigrants and other economic
outsiders.

Tabarrok also noted that immigrant integration is not always
desirable. Immigrants, for example, often have stronger families,
high rates of entrepreneurship, and lower crime rates than do
natives, especially for their education and income levels.

"If natives had the same institutionalization rate as immigrants,"
Tabarrok said, "our jails and prisons would have one-third fewer
inmates."

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PATRICK HENRY

"Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price
of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what
course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me
death!"
   --Patrick Henry (b. 5/29/1736, d. 6/6/1799)

Memorial Day may get more fanfare, but for lovers of liberty Patrick
Henry's birthday is even more significant. While there is no denying
the need for a day of remembrance for the Americans who have died in
battle, what made their sacrifices meaningful is the principle behind
the American Ideal -- the principle articulated most passionately in
Patrick Henry's immortal words, "give me liberty, or give me death."

Ironic though it may at first seem, Henry's fighting words are the
words of a peacemaker. For the only lasting peace is one that arises
from an embrace of the principle of liberty -- peace and liberty are
two sides of the coin of a voluntary society. And the sooner that the
United States and other governments learn this, the less likely that
they will add to the list of those we remember on Memorial Day.

Patrick Henry also reminds us that liberty is not secured overnight.
A decade after the American Revolution, Henry fought hard to secure
the Bill of Rights; he recognized that an unlimited federal
government could be just as tyrannical as the British monarchy.

Patrick Henry should thus be remembered for both his principles and
his realism. A heart and mind united, Henry was a patriot to whom
Americans will always remain in debt.

Happy Birthday, Patrick Henry!

Character Building

During the winter months, with all the snow and cold, you probably
notice the icicles that often form on houses, cars, and trees. Bet you
didn't think of them having a spiritual lesson embedded in them did
you?

Have you ever stopped to consider how they are formed? Have you noticed
that the dripping water froze, one drop at a time, until over a period
of days, the icicle was a foot long or more. If the water is clean, the
icicle remains clear and sparkles brightly in the sunlight; but if the
water is ever so slightly muddy, that icicle will be cloudy. The beauty
and brilliance will be spoiled.

Our character is formed in like manner. Each thought,
every feeling, and all of our actions influence the whole, bit by bit.
Each decision that we make, both great and small, contributes its part.
Everything we take into our minds and souls -- the impressions,
experiences, and words we absorb and use -- all of these work together
to create our character.

We should be aware of the "droplets of influence" we allow to slowly
build our lives. After all, Solomon said, "The integrity of the upright
shall guide them." (Proverbs 11:3)

When the Son shines on your life -- are you clear and clean, or has
your character become cloudy? What droplets of influence are you
putting into your character?

Ken,  I know there is not much anyone can say to you to help you through
what must be the most difficult situation that you or anyone else could
imagine . I just wanted you to know that I think you are being treated very
unfairly by the media. We all know that the media only gets half the story
right and that the half they get right is not often reported. I appreciate
all that you and Enron have done for our city. I believe that over time when
all the pundits are done with the Enron story and the reality of your
contribution to the quality of life in Houston is fully understood there
will be a better story to tell. In the meantime if there is anything I can
do for you please let me know. Take care. Ric Message-ID: <4558456.1075860841019.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

As you are aware, there are  many families that have been affected by the r=
ecent layoffs at Enron.  I  along with two other ex-employees (Karen Cutler=
 and Sue Nix) have been working  on a project which will provide assistance=
 to ex-employees of Enron. We wanted  to do something to help our fellow em=
ployees and also provide a tool that others  could use to provide assistanc=
e to ex-Enron employees. This week, we've been  working with an attorney an=
d a local bank. An account has been set up where  people can make contribut=
ions. All the money will be given back to ex-Enron  employees that need ass=
istance with basic necessities, such as money for food,  rent/mortgage paym=
ents, and utilities. We've contacted the local media with the  information =
so that the community can be made aware of what we're doing. Our  ability t=
o provide assistance will be based on the response we receive.  As  you can=
 see, we're using our values from Enron to help others, and would  apprecia=
te your assistance with communicating this information to the current  Enro=
n employees. =20
Please send this information in a general announcement to the current Enron=
  employees so they can be aware of a way to help their fellow ex-employees=
.   If you need to speak with me or have any questions, I can be reached at=

In the event the foundation closes sooner rather  than later, I was wondering if each of you could possibly write me a letter of  recommendation.  I think it would be good to have a letter from the  President, Vice President and all of the Board of Directors to go along with my  resume.  I would need these letters no later than January 31, 2002.   Thank you in advance.
